    <p ALIGN="left"></font><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a Saturday afternoon in
    Cocoa Beach, the sand is packed with bikini-dad women and muscular surfers.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a routine scene. But, most heads instantly
    pop up to stare at the sight of running men wearing red dresses.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, it's difficult to tell which is
    funnier - the gender-bending runners or the people who seem perplexed by the sight.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who are these guys, anyway?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They call themselves the Brevard Hash House Harriers. They parade
    along a trail in the sand, laughing like giddy school girls and waving at onlookers who
    rise up on their beach towels and shake their heads in amusement.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, the sun worshippers wonder why some of
    the men have painted their fingernails and shaved their legs. Explanations that they are
    simply celebrating the club's second annual &quot;Red Dress Hash&quot; only raise more
    questions.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe it or not, these guys aren't alone. They are part of an
    organization of more than 1,200 chapters worldwide that adhere to the motto &quot;Drinkers
    with a running problem.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though fitness experts might discount their choice of sport and
    warn kids not to try this at home, group members say their main goal is to have fun</font></td>
    <td width="142" valign="top"><font size="3"><p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;It's not about winning; it's more about lampoonery and lunacy,&quot; said Tom
    Fleming, who is referred to by club members only by his moniker, &quot;Edgar Allen
    Ho.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, after five runs, members are given a
    nickname by the group to provide both a sense of anonymity and freedom to those who wish
    to keep their business or personal lives separate from the club, Fleming said.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group hosts biweekly meets (called
    &quot;hashes&quot;) at locations throughout the Space Coast, which includes a running
    event, followed by socializing, singing and beer-drinking games. Often, members don't wait
    until the end of the run to take part in the liquid fun.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You're not going to like this group if you're
    easily offended,&quot; said Kim Todd, who was nicknamed &quot;Fireindahole&quot; when she
    became a Harrier in 1993.</font><br>
    <font size="3"><br>
    </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3">Competitive running is strongly
    discouraged, as the Harriers' events are not races, but more of a game in which one or two
    hares (really just people) set out running, leaving behind a trail of flour. Fifteen
    minutes later, the pack of hounds (more people) set out, tracking the marks in hopes of
    catching up to, and snagging, the hares. The hares will, of course, leave their marks
    clearly, but cleverly, so as to outwit the pack. This is done by leaving false trails and
    by arranging for beer stops along the way.</font></td>
    <td width="140" height="491" valign="top"><font size="3"><p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;When I invite people to come out, the first thing that scares them is the word
    'run,'&quot; Todd said. &quot;But it's not about running - they can run, walk or crawl to
    get to the end. The point is to just 'enjoy the camaraderie with a good ,bunch of
    people.&quot;</p>
    <font FACE="Arial"><p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>The Hash House
    Harriers, which was started in 1938 by a Britisher who gathered several expatriates for a
    &quot;paper chase&quot; in 'what is now Malaysia, has evolved .into a worldwide
    organization and has done so almost entirely by word of mouth, said Paul Nunges, Who
    co-founded the Brevard chapter with his wife and, at age 62, is its oldest member. &nbsp;
    &quot;I've been hashing since the early 1980s and I'll be doing this ,for as long as I
    can,&quot; he said.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nunges, who goes by the nickname &quot;Kojak,&quot; also is a
    member of a subcommittee involved in organizing a global &quot;inter-hash&quot; in which
    about 4,000 Harriers from throughout the world will participate next year in India.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Globally, my experience is that there are a lot of military
    personnel (who are Harriers),&quot; said Nunges. &quot;I've known of runs at military
    bases in which generals participated. It's the same here - you might have doctors, lawyers
    and government employees in the group, (as well as) a guy who mows grass.<font FACE="Arial"></p>
    </font><p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members say they enjoy the companionship
    of the group and doing something in direct contrast to their daily lives.</font></td>
    <td width="157" height="491" valign="top"><font size="3"><p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;You leave the work and the everyday life and just go out and totally clear your
    head,&quot; said member Mark Blackledge, known in the club as &quot;Potty Flavor.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We expect people to be shocked. We were having a blast walking
    down the sidewalk coming in here,&quot; said Shawn Todd, also known as
    &quot;Yanksit,&quot; as he adjusted his dress.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before this year's Red Dress Hash officially began, the Harriers
    lined up for an impromptu gallivant across the stage at Coconuts, and a few members
    lingered to dance and show off their innovative outfits.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While posing for group photos, the guys didn't
    show a hint of embarrassment as they flaunted their stuffed bras and high heels. One
    fellow Harrier winked and hiked his skirt to reveal a garter, which held his credit cards
    in place against his thigh.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's better to run in a dress, because there's
    nothing restricting your legs,&quot; said Blackledge, who mingled with the group of about
    45 Harriers, some of whom came from as far as Jacksonville, Kissimmee and Daytona Beach
    for the run.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Harriers formed a circle to sing a few rather bawdy songs,
    one member set out running, leaving behind the trail of flour.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifteen minutes later, the hounds set out in good spirits,
    tracking the marks in hopes of catching up to the hare, who had left marks to try to
    outwit and slow down the pack by leaving phony trails and arranging for beer stops along
    the way.</font></td>
    <td width="146" valign="top"><font size="3"><p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    distance of the trail varies depending on the hare's personal preference, with most hashes
    covering a 3- to 6- mile distance. The Red Dress Hash, however, covered only about a mile
    and a half.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Typically, our runs are held in parks or in the woods,&quot;
    Fleming said. &quot;This was a pub crawl (type of) run, which we have about twice each
    year, so it was a little shorter.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trail first led the hounds along the side of State Road A1A
    and onto the sand in Cocoa Beach, with a rest stop at the halfway point at the Beach Shack
    bar for foamy refreshments.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By that time, most members had worked themselves
    into a sweaty lather and were eager to cool off with a few cold beers. When the
    &quot;run&quot; resumed shortly thereafter, it remained at the same pace it had begun: a
    brisk walk.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second half of the hash took the giddy
    Harriers along the sidewalks of several streets in Cocoa Beach and in and out of several
    taverns. It concluded at a small beach bar, where members formed a circle around a large
    block of ice and prepared for the traditional &quot;accusations&quot; and
    &quot;infractions.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Harriers lightheartedly accused one another of hashing
    unfairly, such as taking a shortcut which leads off the trail, and pointed out infractions
    which members made along the way.</font></td>
    <td width="113" height="491" valign="top"><font size="3"><p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &quot;It's basically an excuse to drink. When they've been accused, they sit on the ice
    with a full Beer,&quot; Fleming said. &quot;We sing a song and they drink it down.
    Anything they don't finish (is poured) on their head.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having the nerve (if not the proper body shape) to ran in a red
    dress once a year is not the only requirement to be a Harrier; members must be at least 21
    years of age. Instead of collecting membership dues, each Harrier contributes $5 per ran
    to cover the cost of beer and other refreshments.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's not just about coming out in red dresses,&quot; said
    Kim Todd, who has participated in themed runs in Brevard in which the Harriers wore
    Halloween costumes, wedding dresses and togas.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I know I can call on any of these people if
    I need help for anything,- she said. &quot;Gender doesn't have anything to do with it -
    it's more the attitude of the person. All the people are here to have a good time. They're
    looking forward to the trail and where it ends.&quot;</p>
