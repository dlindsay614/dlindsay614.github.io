Guide<br>
<br>
</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt">LENGTH: 
Because we run in the evening, the length of trail 
should be 3 to 3.5 miles, with no half way beer stop. This is so that we can get 
some exercise, have a fun circle, an On After for those who wish, and still get 
home in time to get enough sleep to face work the next day. OK, I admit we have 
all exceeded the 3.5 from time to time but not like the some (set by over 
achieving hares),&nbsp; where it 
was at least 2 miles more than that. You can use Google Earth to plot your trail. If you're 
laying trail with your bike (that will get you a down down) then pay attention 
to that mileage thingy you all have. Or, just go out and run your planned trail. 
If it takes you an hour and a half, it's too long. 45 minutes for a decent 
runner is going to be 3 to 3.5 miles depending on the amount of &quot;stuff&quot; one has 
to deal with out there, canals, etc. <br>
<br>
MARKING TRAIL: Typically we use flour, white or colored, chalk, and toilet paper 
or Kleenex in the heavy shiggy. Not a good idea to use plastic tape as it is not 
bio-degradable. <br>
<br>
Plops/marks should be at a reasonable distance - 75 - 100 feet apart. Yes, you 
can put them on posts, dumpsters, hide them a bit behind trees or telephone 
poles, whatever. They just need to be found reasonably easy. If you're doing 
your trail on a bike you MUST keep the above in mind. Biker hashers tend to leave marks 
much further apart because the pack is moving at a much faster pace.&nbsp; The 
objective is to have fun, not get everyone angry and lost.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
CHECKS, COUNT BACKS, ETC.: This is where the Hare(s) get to have fun. The idea 
is to fool the pack (especially the front running bastards) and make it search for ON ON. Better yet, well thought out 
checks, etc. give a chance for the walkers and the old fart an opportunity to 
catch up. Having the whole pack come into the BN close together is the ideal. 
I'm not going to go into a long dissertation as to how to do these. Go out with 
an experienced Hare and you'll get the idea. <br>
<br>
HARE(S): Now that we are running weekly we cannot rely on just a few 
individuals, Hairy, Doc, to do it all. We all need to pitch in. We have quite a 
few new-comers and virgins and you are all most heartily 
welcome. We encourage you to get the itch (there's a skeeter on....) to lay 
trail, BUT, if you've never done it then PLEASE hook up with one of our 
experienced foot Hares and go along and learn. Then you'll be ready.<br>
<br>
THE ANTHRAX SCARE: In 2001 (I think) when this scare first happened, Hashers all over 
the place were harassed by police, threatened with fines if the HAZMAT teams 
were called out and one Hare in Connecticut actually went to court. I am 
bringing this up because Anthrax is back in the news and two weeks ago the 
police and fire department were actually called out. Here's the deal. If you're 
laying trail in a business district where fast food joints, etc. are still open, 
or your trail is going thru a densely populated neighborhood (or a park with 
kiddies) then just pick up 
the phone and notify the local police before-hand. I know, this goes against our 
nature but better to inform them than get into trouble.<br>
<br>
WATER/LIBATIONS: The hare( is responsible for the beverages, coolers, ice , 
snacks etc.&nbsp; If this is a problem for you ask for help- you can borrow 
coolers and buy the rest.&nbsp; It is very important to have plenty of water available 
for the pack at both the start and end of trail,&nbsp; especially in the hot and muggy 
season. If you take a bottle of water on trail or a 
beer can you MUST carry it to the end of trail unless you find a garbage can or 
dumpster enroute. I know, I know, we see crap out there all over the place from 
homeless people and four-wheelers. However, Hashers around the world are 
environmentally conscious.<br>
<br>
FINALLY: Once again, welcome to all you new-comers. This is wonderful. Our 
little Hash is growing as we had hoped it would. Lolli and I have been Hashing 
for a long time and in many places around this wonderful world. To introduce new 
folks to this very fun game which has been around since 1938 is terrific. So, 
just keep on CUMMING.<br>
<br>
FINALLY FINALLY: I forgot to mention, THERE ARE NO RULES.<br>
<br>
ON ONnn,<br>
