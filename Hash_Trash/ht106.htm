maybe it was a dark and stormy <br>
night? I guess I'll just see what's on hand... &quot;It's fun to be in <br>
Ms. Frizzles class.&quot; If you don't have 7 year olds, you might not be <br>
familiar with The Magic School bus. How ironic, when I was younger, <br>
I always wanted to ride the proverbial magic school bus... I think the <br>
generation before called it the magical mystery tour. <br>
<br>
How did we get to this point? OK, I'm home, out of the shower and <br>
still drinking beer. Better yet, I tevo-ed Caveman (My absolute <br>
favorite movie not named Goodfellas) the other night. Why not grab <br>
the laptop and review tonight's trail?<br>
<br>
Showed up at the meeting point a few minutes early and there's no one <br>
there. Its just starting to rain and the crowd is growing by the <br>
minute. No beer, but, we do have rain and lots of it. Then a little <br>
lightning and a tornado warning. Its Lolli's birthday and if <br>
Spemaid's b-day hash was any indication, this ought to be a hoot. <br>
Next thing I notice, Virgina Miner and Pat-E- Phile pull up and I <br>
can't help, but laugh at how I rescued Miner's cheat vessel and bike <br>
seat from that rabid raccoon I encountered on trail. I was able to <br>
return the seat, but alas, I could not find him in time to return the <br>
cheat vessel. I searched high and low, even rode down the street on <br>
a flat rear tire to return that vessel. The closer I got, the faster <br>
he drove as if it was some sort of grade school prank. Damn you <br>
Miner, I will return your cheat vessel and force you to take it I <br>
thought (as I pedaled as fast as I could). Anyways, I was able to <br>
force the return of the cheat vessel and gave back the $142.00 reward <br>
Miner wanted me to take. It was just a good deed. Don't make a <br>
habit out of losing your vessel. I can't always be there to watch <br>
out for you.<br>
<br>
Next thing you know, Miner's got on a yellow plastic bag that <br>
say &quot;hazardous materials handle, with caution.&quot; Where do you get <br>
this stuff? I should have got one from you. Save one and I will <br>
humbly accept it as a token of your gratitude for returning your <br>
vessel. Not that you owe me, that way you won't feel like you have to <br>
give me the $142.00.<br>
<br>
Off to Lollipop's and Kojak's house since the weather is so bad. Its <br>
not raining as hard beachside so we decide to spread a little liquid <br>
cheer and drink some beer. The weather clears up, beer is flowing, <br>
why not run a hash. I can't remember how it came up, but, now Harry <br>
and myself are thinking about a live trail in a few minutes. Its <br>
down some more beer, grab some flour and off we go. Head east, round <br>
the corner and throw in a countback square root of 169. A relative <br>
sees me in her front yard writing on her driveway and asks if I'm <br>
doing &quot;one of those hash runs.&quot; She then explains it to an older <br>
lady walking her dog and she yells &quot;you got room for one more?&quot; Run <br>
around, throw some flour, My old house is right here and here's where <br>
Harry grew up surfing and gettin' his mojo rising. Off we go, true <br>
trail at A1A.. Nope! it's a countback to true trail! Those <br>
dagnabbit hares are tricky tonight! Math problems? Count back to non <br>
count back type of plops! Bastards! Over A1A and next thing we know <br>
we're storming the beaches! Down to the Double tree, across A1A, <br>
round the Re/Max office and 17 plops leading right up to the beer <br>
near. The block of ice has a wonderful cooter ridge this evening. <br>
Colder than normal as well. Budweiser, Miller Lite, Bud Select an <br>
Busch fills the coolers. Almost forgot to mention Lolli's crazy <br>
black bean salsa (the roasted corn made it over the top good), <br>
Habanero Doritos, a tray of radishes and even some queso graced the <br>
garage. Quick circle due to the late start. A good time. <br>
Highlights of the hash: Toothfairy was heard saying he wasn't <br>
leaving until all the beer was gone. Swax came back looking for Slow <br>
Poker's purse. I suggest a Penis Hash the same night as the Bunny <br>
Hash's bachlorette party/hash. Fin quickly commented that we need to <br>
know where it is so that we won't show up on accident. Good One. <br>
Slow Poker was also heard saying that yes he did have a Penis, he <br>
just had to get permission to check it out of the house. Spermaid <br>
keeping his pants up for once. Krusty, will yo please come to the <br>
hash mre often so that he does keep his pants up! At least that the <br>
way I remember the night. If you version is different, post it. <br>
Just let it be known that mine is more accurate.<br>
<br>
On out!<br>
<br>
Snip It<br>

Life's Lessons #82 When being chased by a large dinosaur, run to <br>
the nearest marijuana plant, pick the marijuana berries and throw <br>
them into the mouth of the dinosaur. The dinosaur will swallow the <br>
berries and not get the munchies and then try and eat you. You will <br>
be saved. Whoever kept a pot plant long enough to grow berries? <br>
Come on, as soon as that plant was taller than your dick, you were <br>
looking to dry it out and smoke it.</b></font>
