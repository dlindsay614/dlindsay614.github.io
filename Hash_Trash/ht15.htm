<p>Well, your On-sec was outa town for this Full Moon Hash so there&#146;s not a lot of
trash to spread. All that can be said is hearsay. So, I heard that even with a very small
group of 7 hashers, they had a great time (no, not the BVD H3!). I heard that a lot of
drinking took place&#133;again, what a surprise! And, I heard they sat on ice behind a
bar, or something like that, and I heard they howled at the moon. And that&#146;s all I
heard.</p>

<p>For those of you who may be aspiring (hmmm) to be an On-sec someday, an Outlaw Hash
Trash is the perfect way to get your foot in the door. Okay, so what is it? It&#146;s a
hash trash written by someone other than the Hash On-sec. The perfect time to draft up one
of these Outlaw Hash Trashes is when the On-sec misses a hash (though very abnormal for
this On-sec). </p>

<p>Some of you unfamiliar to hashing may be wondering where the tradition of the Trash
came from. Well, don&#146;t ask me, because I don&#146;t know. (I&#146;m sure someone way
smarter than me will let me know&#151;go ahead smarty pants, I dare ya). I do know that
most hash groups love to boast about the longevity of their existence. For this purpose,
Hash Trashes make great historical documents. And, people love to read about themselves,
and about smut&#133;the raunchier the better. Anyway, I&#146;ve Bsed enough. On-Out until
the next BVD H3 Hash!</font>
