<p>BVD hashers were welcomed on hash #6 with plenty of sun, beer, and a visit from slick
Willy himself! Yes, we were really impressed by Surf&#146;s impersonation skills, but more
importantly, he had all our harrierettes wishing they were interns! Thirty hashers, to
include four virgins, were prepared to chase down our two live hares, Surf and Cum Chum.
They laid a rather earthy trail through woods, parks, and streams. About 1.5 miles into
the trail, we spotted the hashmobile at the half-way beer stop (along with the hares),
across a murky, thigh high water drainage ditch, complete with algae. A choice had to be
made. Do we follow the true trail, possibly remaining dry, or do we make a beeline to the
beer? Not a difficult choice when beer is involved! Though I do have to mention that a few
hashers used a baseball bench to cross over the ditch rather than to brave the elements.
Repeat after me&#133;.shiggy is good! After the beer-stop, we were on-out again through a
neighborhood, and more off-road trail through a palmetto forest. (Cum Chum told us later
that he had carved some of the trail with a good pair of shears) We ended outside in a
clearing with a keg and tons of munchies&#151;hot wings, fresh fruit, and chips&#151;BVD
hashers never had it so good! We circled up for the down-down awards, starting with the
hares, then the newbys. The HUYA was awarded to Yanksit for over-achieving as a movie
extra in an upcumming Walt-Disney flick. Just Wayne was named Cum Chum because he survived
three shark attacks during his military days (Sir Flatulot wanted me to mention that the
name Cum Chum was his idea&#151;he said all the other names were lame). I think we had
some accusation down-downs, but by the end of the keg, who can remember. The keg was
polished off, and a few die-hards were on-out to the on-after&#151;Mullet and
Hoosierdaddy&#146;s house. We drank some more and finished off what snacks they had in the
house before we all headed out to Long Doggers. With a little pre-warning (phone call),
they had tables set up just for us. We downed some more grubbage and definitely more beer.
Some of the other patrons with children in tow didn&#146;t appreciate our loud, obnoxious
songs. What a surprise! Just Scott got into a pissing contest with a rather feisty
lady-wanna-be, but her husband calmed her down in no time. As far as I know, all the
hashers left peacefully without being thrown out&#151;damn the misfortune!<br>
Until next hash&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.On-out and beer be with you! </font>
