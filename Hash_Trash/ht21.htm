Although we had a rather small gathering of hashers for BVD H3&#146;s 21<sup>st</sup>
hash, we were nothing less than eager to hit the trail to find out what our cunning hares,
Cum Chum and Chomper, had in store for us. During the chalk talk, we were told to look for
million dollar bills hanging on trail and to snag them up for a prize raffle at the end.
Since this was Cum Chomper&#146;s virgin &quot;live&quot; lay, we gave the hares a good
HEAD start. They lived up to their reputation for laying primarily off-road, wet trails.
We began from the same abandoned Wal-Mart parking lot that we used several hashes ago, but
took a different turn into the palmettos. We enjoyed the trails as well as two water
crossings. The half-way point brought us to the Cums&#146; middle-class yacht. Cum Chomper
sat perched on top, handing out thirst quenchers (beer and &quot;champagne&quot;). We
headed back out on trail through more palmetto fields, baseball fields and ended with the
2<sup>nd</sup> water crossing. After approximately four miles, the Beer Near took us back
to the Wal-Mart parking lot. While we were out on trail, Cum Comper, MoanerBoner, and
Hoosier Daddy sat in the Wal-Mart parking lot waiting for our return. A tow truck arrived
and the driver confronted our harriettes and said that we were on private property and the
owners had instructed him to tow all the cars away. With beer in hand (CC) and cigarette
in mouth (Moaner/Hoosier) our harriettes proceeded to explain that they belonged to a
local running group. Needless to say, the driver wasn&#146;t impressed with their
&quot;story&quot; and proceeded to hook up Turd Burglar&#146;s car. He explained that he
had a job to do unless the owners told him differently. Our quick thinking harriettes dug
out a cell phone and called the owners who promptly told the tow truck driver to get lost
for awhile and if we weren&#146;t gone soon, to start towing the cars. That&#146;s about
when everyone came in from trail and we proceeded to an alternate ending spot a few miles
away. When all this excitement fizzled out, we circled up and did our down-downs. I was
the first person called into the circle for screwing with the hash names in the last
&quot;trash.&quot; Jeez&#133;some people can be so sensitive. I&#146;ll try not to hurt
your feelings next time&#133;RIGHT! Then the Cums&#146; gave away &quot;gifts&quot; by
drawing numbers from the millionaire bills found on trail. Yanksit won just about
everything&#133;a trip to the Bahamas (no shit), a stuffed animal, and a bottle of
champagne. Next, we did down-downs for the hares, Pocket Rocket for using wanker names in
the circle, Yanksit &amp; Red Hot Anal Pepper for &quot;best dressed&quot;, FRB hat to
Screwy Rabbit, DFL to Harry Cheeseballs and Mullet for first in at the beer stop, Bitch Be
Gone for third in (?), Just Ted for cumming late to the hash, Hoosier from saving the day
with the Tow Truck adventure, &quot;matching clothes&quot; down-downs, no hash shirt, 50%
rule, and a whole bunch of accusations. And that about wraps up BVD H3 #21! </font>
