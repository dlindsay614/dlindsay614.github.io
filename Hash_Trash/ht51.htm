HARES: I'd Fuck Her &amp; Dr. Without Socks<br>
THEME: Hash-O-Ween Hash<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial"><big>About 25 or so appropriately dressed Hashers met at the
Pour House on S.<br>
Patrick Drive.&nbsp; Costumes were everything from Little Red Riding Hood to<br>
Hagar with a disproportionate number of Hashers in drag</big><br>
<big>(what's with that anyway).<br>
<br>
THE RUN:&nbsp; (yeah, right)!!!</big><br>
<big><br>
THE ON AFTER: (or, before on after), it seems that the largest portion<br>
of the well dressed group either had a clue or just decided &quot;fuck it&quot;<br>
and returned to the Pour House to sit with that skinny littly smug faced<br>
bastard and drink beer.&nbsp; Those few of us who fell for the &quot;TRICK&quot;<br>
returned a bit later and had to wait an unbelievable amount of time for<br>
a sip of the brew.&nbsp; Talk about a piece of crap from the gitgo.&nbsp; And<br>
there he sat with his shit eatin little grin &quot;I got you guys&quot;.</big><br>
<big>We'll see who has the last laugh.<br>
<br>
THE CIRCLE:&nbsp; The &quot;Hares&quot; (what Hares) were called in and the crowd let<br>
them know what they thought of this abomination.&nbsp; Co-Hare, IFH,<br>
immediately begged off, in her cute l'il Carolina draaaawwwwl,</big><br>
<big>&quot;it was his idea&quot;!<br>
<br>
There was a best costume contest and all I remember is there was a tie. <br>
Why Edwina Alaine Ho didn't win hands down is beyond your humble<br>
scribe.&nbsp; She looked HOT.</big><br>
<big>(and thank 'G' I'll be seeing Lollipop at Gobble gobble).<br>
<br>
And there were condoms everywhere.</big><br>
<big>From a six foot one to a whole condom Salad.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
NAMINGS:&nbsp; just Brian will forever more be known as VAGINA.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just Richard, who damned near got
in bed with Martha ended up with SUCK-U-LATER.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just Duane who came as Huck Finn is
now know as FUCKLEBERRY.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Yes, with a 'C'. Despite Huck's
trying to convince your correspondent otherwise,</big><br>
<big>a mini MsMgmt. meeting was called all agreed, WITH A 'C'.&nbsp; Your humble reporter
learned his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fuCking lesson last time (Bike
Bitch, you sneaky bastard).<br>
<br>
And then we Swang Low and the fun continued into the wee witching hours.<br>
<br>
ICE:&nbsp; Yes Dr. WS there will be ice waiting for your butt.<br>
<br>
On Out,<br>
