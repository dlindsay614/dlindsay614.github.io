<p>BVD Hash #10 started out with one helluva storm, but we still had a great turn out! For
those of you who aren&#146;t aware, our Religious Advisor is responsible for the weather,
good or bad. And for hash #10, our very own RA, Yanksit, ordered sunshine! And so it was.
The on-before party took place in Yanksit&#146;s love mobile. Hmmm&#133;.how many hashers
can you fit in a van? Sounds like a fun experiment. Before long, our live hares, Ball
Breaker and K9 Cum Shot, were off. Soon after, our hounds were in hot pursuit. The trail
led us out of the park and down a trail. Under the interstate, and through the woods, to
Gispert&#146;s hash house we go. The trail was very back woodsy--the kind of terrain that
hashers love. We emerged from the woods and made our way through a housing area. We soon
found Red Hot Anal Pepper anxiously awaiting the hounds at the halfway beer stop. Of
course, to get to the beer, we had to cross a small water ditch. What&#146;s a hash
without squishy feet? After the beer stop, we were on-back the way we came, except the
hare cut out most of the woods and led us under the interstate and BEER NEAR to the park.
It&#146;s important to mention that the SW Bs crossed paths with the FRBs on their way to
the BEER NEAR. So the SWBs followed the FRBs to the end, cutting out half of the
trail&#151;lucky bastards! The hares had a keg waiting for the thirsty hounds. In line
with the hash theme, the hares hid plastic Easter eggs filled with candy in the park. The
hounds grabbed up the eggs and were instructed to look for various letters marked on the
inside. Some hounds received gift certificates, and chocolate, while a couple of
&quot;fortunate&quot; hashers (Surf &amp; Blowfish) were rewarded with &quot;butt&#146;s
on ice.&quot; We circled up for the down-downs. First were the hares on ice. A BVD virgin,
Just Thomas was welcomed to the group and drank out of his lovely, new, running shoes.
FRBs, Cum Chum and Ass Backwards, sat on ice and did down-downs. Cum Chum caused quite a
stir in the group&#151;something about his hairy ass. K9 Cum Shot rewarded the HUYA to Cum
Chum to slow down this FRB at the next hash. Just Scott was named Sissy Bitch. Rumor has
it he took off his shoes and socks to cross the waterway at the half-way beer stop. Shame
on you, Sissy Bitch! Don&#146;t fret&#133;before long, you&#146;ll be the first one in the
river and bragging to friends about it. Kojak, our GM, sat on ice for instigating the
Space Coast article covering our red dress hash. Kojak read the article in storybook
style, with the exception of a brief moment when our hare&#146;s dog took a liking to
Kojak&#146;s bare butt on ice&#133;nuf said. All the SWBs did down-downs for short-cutting
the trail. And finally, Da Shit was invited to sit on ice for washing up during a hash.
What can you say? She looked great and the dog wasn&#146;t the least bit interested in her
bottom. The hashers polished off the keg and some headed to the on-after party at some
wanker&#146;s house. Of course, we crashed the party, but we <i><b>were </b></i>the party!
Oh yeah, Edgar Allan Ho is not allowed to wear the button &quot;I have not done it with
Moaner Boner.&quot; That about does it for BVD hash #10! </font>
