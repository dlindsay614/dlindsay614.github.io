<p>Well, the hasher bike weekend in Daytona was everything I&#146;d heard it to
be&#151;lots of beer, bikes, and wild parties! It all started out with hashers gathering
at the Best Western Mayan Hotel, to register and meet at poolside with the first tapped
keg. About 150 people were there for the first night&#146;s pub-crawl which included two
of Daytona&#146;s finest bars&#151;&quot;finest&quot; cause they tolerate hashers and
their wild antics! We eventually stumbled back to the Mayan for more beer and a little
shuteye (very little---this weekend wasn&#146;t about getting a good night&#146;s sleep).
Saturday proved to be even more exciting with the famous hash trail through Daytona. A
pack of 220 hashers, with whistles blowing, hashed down the middle of main street with
hundreds of bikers watching. Seeing the bikers&#146; faces with that expression of
&quot;What the hell are they doing?&quot; was definitely the highlight of the weekend. The
hash turned out to be a long pub-crawl with three beer stops&#151;one bar and two hotels.
The first hotel proved to be an exciting time with pole climbing, a D-J, pole dances,
bikini-clad women, and lots of beer. We ended our pub-crawl a short walk down the beach to
the Berncastle (or something like that) Pub. Little by little, the hashers stumbled back
to the Mayan&#151;another short walk down the beach. All the hashers did their own thing
for the evening&#151;some ventured downtown&#151;some passed out in their rooms. One of
our very own, Deep Stick, spent the night in the hospital. By morning, she made her way
back to the Mayan to share stories of hospital torture. The pack had thinned out a little
for the hangover hash on Sunday. Those remaining lounged around the pool in the hot sun
for a couple of hours before heading out on our final hash. We were on-out and down the
beach, back to the Berncastle. We drank, ate, and drank some more until our tab ran out.
We circled up for some ritual down-downs, hash songs, and then we were on-back home. We
survived Bike Week 2000! </font>
