The hounds gathered for BVD Hash no. 57 in a vacant field off of Malabar Road in Palm Bay.
&nbsp;Our hare of the day was none other than <b>Edgar Allen Ho </b>celebrating his 2nd
analversary of hashing. &nbsp;(Way to go Ho!) <br>
When the pack had assembled we had many of our regular hounds joined by visitors <b>Up
Chuck F*ck</b> from Jax, <b>Pussy Gourmet</b> from Orlando, <b>Sir Flatchalot</b> and <b>Gilligan
</b>from Daytona Beach. &nbsp;I know, these guys are almost BVD&#146;ers, but it sounds
good to have a lot of visitors. &nbsp;So, welcome hashers. &nbsp;<b>S-Wax </b>gathered the
hash cash and a card was passed around for signing and well-wishing of <b>Indiana Jerk Off</b>
from Daytona - who met with a nasty roof vs. gravity accident in the past few weeks.
&nbsp;Get well <b>I.J.O.!</b><br>
<br>
Da Ho&#146;s chalk talk was short and sweet except for the bit about wild animals on
trail. &nbsp;Seems Da Ho ran across big cat and bear tracks in his travels. &nbsp;It was
quickly decided that <b>Dr. Anus</b> and <b>Suckulater </b>would be the only ones eaten on
trail as Dr. Anus is out front and Suckulater (in the rear) was the largest, juiciest
morsel to hit the Malabar woods in some time. &nbsp;After the chalk talk and group grope
&nbsp;Da Ho was gone like the wind. The hash sang Father Abraham and was on-on into the
wood.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Shiggy? &nbsp;Who said Shiggy? &nbsp;The hounds found trail and headed north into a
large open field that had palmettos, briars, brambles and ankle breakers every step of the
way. &nbsp;After a long YBF, the shiggy continued to get deeper, thicker and more intense
until cuming to the sugar sand. &nbsp;Most of the hounds were bleeding after crossing the
mud and briar patch so numbness had set in by the time the sugar sand and more woods
brought us to the fire breaks. &nbsp;BVD has been saddled with themes and highway hashes
for a while and to my thinking we were finally back to what hashing is supposed to be, the
trail was well marked and difficult to maneuver. &nbsp;The hare did well and lead the pack
to the eventual circle on a vacant road out of public viewing.<br>
<br>
With all the hounds having made the run, our GM <b>Fireindahole </b>and RA <b>Yanksit </b>took
the hash from here and we all circled up. &nbsp;The Ho was iced as hare, <b>Just Puke</b>
held story hour from his throne on the ice as the hash hummed and swayed to Kum-By-Ya.
&nbsp;We had some over achiever down-downs for marathon runners (<b>Flatch, Pussy Gourmet,
Without Socks, I.F.H</b>). &nbsp;The HUYA was passed from <b>Salad Shooter </b>to <b>Kojak
</b>for his &#145;No Theme - Theme&quot;. &nbsp;Our FRB Sir Flatch was joined for a down
down by <b>Dick Sniffah</b>&#146; as DFL. &nbsp;Somewhere in the mess of down-downs we had
an attack on our honorable Grand Mattress by Up Chuck F*ck our visitor from Jax.
&nbsp;When that was settled we moved into the naming. &nbsp;<b>Just Marilyn </b>took the
ice and after much deliberation, she was named &nbsp;&quot;<b>In-My-Mouth</b>&quot;.
&nbsp;Now reflect on this for a moment, next year the Christmas cards will be addressed
&quot;<b>Bike Bitch, In-My-Mouth</b>&quot;. &nbsp;That thought will give me nightmares.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Announcements were made reminding people to check the web page links and
especially to register for the Savannah Analversary camp out in May. &nbsp;&nbsp;Business
complete, the lovely songmeister led Swing Low and we departed to Mo&#146;s for the
On-After.<br>
See you all in two weeks. <br>

Truly, &nbsp;I have been doing this for years, I just didn&#146;t know it was called
HASHING! <b>-Bike Bitch 2001. </b><br>
