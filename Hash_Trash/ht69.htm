JULY 20, 21, 2002. &nbsp;WICKHAM PARK</font></b><font size="2"><br>
<br>
</font><font size="3"><b>It was Friday, the 19th of July in the dark of the
night that it started. &nbsp;Quietly yet steadily they rolled toward Brevard
County. &nbsp;From the north, from the west, from the south they came. &nbsp;Each
Harrier and Harriette felt the calling, like hounds to the hunt. A pre-lube was
held, where drinks were drank, Fire sang and shots were gobbled. &nbsp;The hash
was ready, oh what a night!<br>
<br>
Saturday morning mismanagement began to gather in Wickham Park to prepare for
the 69th Run of BVDH3. &nbsp;Their was beer to be tapped, set ups to set up and
tents to erect. &nbsp;When what to our wondering eyes did appear but heads
popping up from bushes and palms. &nbsp;Anal Inspector and Tits on a Leash
having Jello for breakfast and there in the woods was the infamous Slut Hut from
South Florida. &nbsp;Lil’ Dribble and Cum Chowder had arrived in the night.
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Set ups began, Kojak tapped keg #1 of 5. &nbsp;Registration was set up and tent
city began to be built. &nbsp;Our GM Fireindahole was well in control and
organized tasks. &nbsp;IFH had a list and began the Bare-Assed Butt Painting.
&nbsp;Puke and Wiggles brought Ice and a Keg. &nbsp;<i>Note to self:</i> &nbsp;After
getting a giant &quot;J &quot; and a giant &quot; U &quot; on each cheek in
brightly colored Permanent Sharpie, do not go to the gym and get naked in the
men’s locker room. &nbsp;You will attract more attention than you want. &nbsp;Sharpie
lasts 4 days.<br>
<br>
Hashers began to arrive from all over. Dick-Upon-A-Star bringing Just Charles
from South Carolina. &nbsp;Tooth Fairy from Georgia. &nbsp;Blow Job came from
Washington, DC. &nbsp;Tuna Helper from South FL, Ram Tuff and the west coast
gang came too. &nbsp;With registration underway each hasher got a goody bag with
a yellow IB6 UB9 shirt courtesy of the recent Yanksit in Korea trip and other
various goodies. &nbsp;&nbsp;Once registered and the beer flowing, it was time
to gather up for a chalk talk and get this hash No. 69 On-trail.<br>
<br>
Yanksit and Without Socks gave a chalk talk for the Virgins and the hash flash
took pictures. &nbsp;Asses painted, boobs striped and starred, the hounds were
On-Out. &nbsp;On-through the woods around the park, no whistles through the
horse area and On-around the Community College to the end back at camp. &nbsp;Great
trail hares.. you will pay.<br>
<br>
The circle began around the World Record block of ice that had been delivered
for the event. &nbsp;300 pounds of nut chillin torture sat shining in the circle
and waiting for its victims.<br>
<br>
The hounds wondered in with a heavy pack at the front with IFH, Dr. Anus, Snail
Trail, Just Colleen, Ram Tuff, Way Beyond Gay.. who the hell knows the rest..
&nbsp;&nbsp;The few drunken DFL’s came dragging in from behind. &nbsp;Wait!
Surf and Sky Box had joined the trail from somewhere near the end, Tooth Fairy
came driving up and got included in the DFL list too. &nbsp;Yanksit took charge
as RA and gathered the hashers together. &nbsp;Jello Shots and beer and beer and
beer and beer then the circle was ready.<br>
<br>
The Hares were iced, FRB’s and DFL’s spent a long time &quot;chillin&quot;.
&nbsp;Hashers from far and near were iced; West Palm Beach, Palatka, Tampa, Jax,
Georgia, South Carolina, and one not-so-lonely hasher from South Africa. &nbsp;All
in all the hash had grown to around 50 hounds at this point. &nbsp;A good party
was in store for the night. &nbsp;The HUYA was passed from Stumbelina to Short
Straw (a record holder for the HUYA). &nbsp;And it was time for a naming. &nbsp;Just
Charles had been on 4 prior hashes and BVD took the opportunity to name a
visitor. &nbsp;Just Charles sat long on the ice for his baptism into the
hash…He has been named Jizz Spitter. &nbsp;With business concluded and a drink
to &quot;G&quot;, &nbsp;we sang &quot;Swing Low&quot; and were on out to dinner.
&nbsp;&nbsp;A note from the hash, &nbsp;Anal Inspector and Tooth Fairy together
know every hash song ever written. &nbsp;Thanks guys.<br>
<br>
Dinner was catered and the feast began. &nbsp;Great food and plenty of it.
&nbsp;Fireindahole had arranged a great dinner for the camp. &nbsp;Best of all
no cooking.<br>
<br>
And then it happened.. CREEPY GUY.. and creepy wife.. arrived out of the dark,
like some horror film beast from the woods. &nbsp;Creepy guy revealed that he
worked in the park as part of his Community Control. &nbsp;(Charge: exposing
himself). &nbsp;He also told a story about being a marathon runner and needing
sponsors. &nbsp;RIGHT.<br>
<br>
The Shooting Star hash was all about shots and Apple Pucker, &nbsp;Apple Pies
and Cinnamon Shots. &nbsp;Wow.. &nbsp;my head is spinning.<br>
<br>
As dark settled in the woods the electric sounds of thump, thump, thump club
music began to wail. &nbsp;Suck Me Dry and Miss Clitty Clitty Bang Bang had
erected a Techno Tent, complete with electronics, lasers and black lights, sound
system and body paints. &nbsp;Outside an inflatable pool with water fountain and
Tiki Torch lights. &nbsp;Damn these hashers are hard core. &nbsp;You two KICK
ASS! &nbsp;The Slut Hut was Rockin! &nbsp;The Techno Area had the best camp site
on record. &nbsp;Dancing, Swinging and painting the camp. &nbsp;Major Bation,
looking fine as ever with B.O.B. close behind, Tuna Helper was swinging with
fine breasts painted. &nbsp;Raggedy Anal danced and Tits on a Leash made it off
to the lake for a midnight swim. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Creepy Guy was getting head from creepy wife about every 10 minutes (no wonder
about the prior arrests). &nbsp;BVDH3 hash 69 was in full swing. &nbsp;Short
Straw was dancing in party pants that didn't need a black light to glow, &nbsp;beer
was consumed by the gallons. &nbsp;Ass Packet and Circle Blow were both Circle
Blown Away and &nbsp;Mr. Packet wandered aimlessly around with no pants for some
time. &nbsp;Circle blow twice ran by the Suckulater Tent screaming.. I am naked
- I am naked.. &nbsp;as P. Diddy would say &quot;Tru Dat&quot;. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Bike Bitch, IFH and Without Socks opted out of the tent life to drift on home
and enjoy the benefits of air conditioning. Stumbelina by now was doing back
strokes in the Techno Tent Wading Pool with Up Chuck Fuck, Tuna Helper, Lil
Dribble and Jizz Spitter all enjoying water. &nbsp;Ok Jizz Spitter was making
water.. which cleared the pool quick. &nbsp;Rub-Her-Butt was dancing the night
away. &nbsp;Fade to black.<br>
<br>
Sunday morning came with the crack of lightening and a rain shower at 7am.
&nbsp;Enough rain to stir the campers and wake the mosquitoes. &nbsp;The rain
was brief and hashers crawled toward the food pavilion. &nbsp;S-Wax had prepared
a breakfast for 10,000. &nbsp;We had muffins and donuts and bagels and cheeses,
Danish and rolls and mounds of butters and jams with our beer. &nbsp;Keg &nbsp;no.
5 was tapped and Anal Inspector wheeled out the remaining 240 grape jello shots.
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As with any hash, a game was started where through bloodshot eyes if your name
was called and you could open both eyes, &nbsp;Yanksit, Anal and Snail Trail
were throwing shots at you. &nbsp;They continued to throw them until you caught
one. &nbsp;You had to eat all that you missed.<br>
<br>
Ram-Tuff or Snail Trail I cant remember which, started making the Bloody
Mary’s. &nbsp;At approx 9am the hash was in full form again. &nbsp;Short Straw
led the hangover hash tent to tent awaking any late cummers. &nbsp;Gamey Gonads
was a vision that crawled out of her tent holding her head and walked the 200
feet to the bathroom applying pressure to each side of her head. &nbsp;Her eyes
were puffy and we wondered if we should call 911. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The hash continued into the day with hounds drifting in and hounds drifting out.
&nbsp;All in all this hash was an AMAZING success. &nbsp;BVD’s first camp out
had fun and laughter and trails, dancing, food and ice and new friends and
Virgins. &nbsp;The visitors from hashes far and near added great entertainment.
&nbsp;Mismanagement did an excellent job at food preps, beer, ice, goody bags,
advertising etc. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
To all who worked, to all who came a grateful thanks. &nbsp;You are all the
best. &nbsp;To those that missed it, &nbsp;don’t ever miss this again - It
Rocked!<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
May the Hash Go in Peace.<br>
