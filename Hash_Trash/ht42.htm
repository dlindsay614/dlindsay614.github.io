<p>BVDH3 Run #42 Hash Trash<br>
<br>
This is a bit late but after all of the decadent nonsense we have been<br>
reading all week it is timely.<br>
<br>
A small group of hale and hearty REAL Hashers assembled at Darby's<br>
(brand new) bar on US 1 near Post Road in Melbourne.&nbsp; Darby's is a<br>
typical small FL Cracker bar with loud music from the juke box and live<br>
music weekend eves.<br>
<br>
This was an A to A run Hared by Yanksit.&nbsp; The Hare was off at the usual<br>
hour while the rest of the pack continued to sip a cool one or two as it<br>
was a very hot and humid day with rain threatening.&nbsp; After the usual<br>
allotted time the six pack was off (seventh being Fire in Da Hole who<br>
motor hashed, but, hey, she was driving the half way beer truck).&nbsp; The<br>
pack meandered along Post Road and some other familiar venues until<br>
finally, with tongues hanging out, we arrived at the half way in Wickham<br>
Park.&nbsp; FRB E.H. Ho had already had a couple of brews by the time us slow<br>
bastards got there.&nbsp; After a rather long stop but with thirsts quenced<br>
we were off once again, around a lake, through an RV campground &quot;are you<br>
guys following the flour too&quot;, answer, &quot;only way to get to the beer&quot;. <br>
&quot;Oh&quot;!&nbsp; Once again we entered some familiar territory but since we were<br>
doing it in reverse from last time it was kind of fun viewing Mom nature<br>
from the other direction.&nbsp; I think most of us knew we were going back to<br>
Darby's (even though A to A was not mentioned, but nobody shortcutted. <br>
REAL Hashers do the trail.&nbsp; We finally arrived at Darby's and it was<br>
still quite light out being one of the longest days of daylight of the<br>
year.&nbsp; We circled up inside the bar along with our block of ice and<br>
entertained the locals.&nbsp; Acting GM, yours truly, started the festivities<br>
and immediately had our Hare in for a seat.&nbsp; After his down down he got<br>
to stay for another as it had been learned that in the wanker world he<br>
had been promoted to &quot;Testical Sergeant&quot;.&nbsp; I think this means he now<br>
wears five stripes but he is still outranked by his better half.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Then the RA took over and everyone got a chance to test the quality and<br>
coolness of the ice including Just Strings (I don't remember his friggin<br>
name but he was the scheduled guitar picker for the evening).&nbsp; He swore<br>
he liked it and than he would join us.&nbsp; Yeah, right.<br>
<br>
Yours truly got the last very long seat and was joined at one point by<br>
Fire because she attempted to drink all the rum in the Bahamas (silly<br>
girl) with hurling results.&nbsp; Some gd Cracker approached and rubbed yours<br>
truly's head saying &quot;I like you&quot;.&nbsp; Thank &quot;G&quot; I am a very
disciplined<br>
(USMC training) person and knew I couldn't leave the ice without<br>
permission otherwise I probably would have decked the bastard.&nbsp; Turns<br>
out he was a friggin retired swabbie.&nbsp; F*%#ing anchor clanckers are all<br>
a bunch of fags.&nbsp; Gotta bring Potty to this place.<br>
<br>
With appropriate festivity and blessings the RA ended the circle and we<br>
continued drinking until the cash ran out.&nbsp; Some went on to Sperm<br>
Maker's (or something like that) house and some went home (me for one)<br>
but a hell of a good time was head by all.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Amazing what good clean wholesome fun you can have with a few nice<br>
people.&nbsp; Nobody showing off their tits, (though we did have a little lap<br>
dance demonstration), nobody swapping a cherry among 20 some odd mouths<br>
YUKHHHHH, (you people are sickos), and nobody camp fire jumping HA HA HA<br>
HA.&nbsp; And that cute chick letting that old fart from Daytona massage her<br>
boobies (you people are sickos).&nbsp; Y'all should have stayed up there.<br>
<br>
Hey, did anybody notice that in that missive written by the good Doctor<br>
Without (brains) that running or a run was not even mentioned (if it was<br>
I missed it).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Next run:&nbsp; 2ND ANAL RED DRESS (absolutely required), Saturday, July 7,<br>
in Cocoa Beach.&nbsp; Stay tuned for details.<br>
