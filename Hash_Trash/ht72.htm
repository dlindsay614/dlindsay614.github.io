South they said. &nbsp;South of the bridges, south of the border, south of Short
Straw’s, south of Poker’s, south of Kojak’s, south of Stumbelina’s we
did go. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
On August 17th 2002 On-South we went, to the land of Sunshine and Grapefruits,
Environmental Protection Agents and West Nile Virus bearing mosquitoes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Those hashers that paid attention, knew to hang a left at the SBI sign, but alas
three blocks south of SBI the Suckulater and Bike Bitch pulled a U-turn and
headed back to the parking lot. &nbsp;Our GM and heavy footed RA blew past the
SBI at 70 mph making a comment to each other that &quot;That Place&quot; would
make a great hash bar. &nbsp;They continued southward to the Inlet before
deciding &quot;That Place&quot; in fact was &quot;THE Place&quot; for TODAY and
they were lost.<br>
<br>
The hashers not venturing off to join our brethren at Banana Island in Daytona
began to gather and greet each other with apprehension as to what punctuality
hashes are all about. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hashing/Punctuality is an Oxymoron.<br>
<br>
Old timers Krusty Kream and Sperm Aid joined us (too long between hashes).
&nbsp;Snail Trail showed up again (cool). &nbsp;Stumbelina brought Just Thomas
back and in the door came Just Jacques. &nbsp;It was beginning to look like a
respectable hash when 13 hounds showed and were ready to run.<br>
<br>
Our hare of the day Short Straw had pre-printed the Chalk Talk and run off
copies. &nbsp;Bike Bitch-Fauchitis was driving the rental beer vehicle. &nbsp;Later
Dr. Anus would sub as Beer Meister Wannabe.<br>
<br>
Punctuality is a myth as the Hare was away at 4:27.. and left the hounds
standing at the Yanksit-mobile drinking (cold-free-beer). &nbsp;Thirty minutes
or so had passed and the hounds were away.<br>
<br>
South on the beach then west through a neighborhood took the FRB pack 2 miles
out of the way before discovering a trap. &nbsp;A big circle on all paved roads
with the temperature 98 degrees, it added fun to the sprint. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Snail Trail being 2 miles ahead of the pack lapped the rotund Suckulater and
Stumbelina informing them to turn back. &nbsp;Now proceeding north on A1A then
west again and into the shiggy. &nbsp;It was hot as hell and heat stroke was
setting in well when a few hounds broke through the deep shiggy and into the
orange grove and our first Bear Near. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Running at the mid-point of the pack was Just Jacques when he broke through the
shiggy holding his heart. &nbsp;The nervous pack waited for him to die or go for
the cooler. &nbsp;An uncomfortable moment passed.. tic.. toc.. tic.. toc..
tic..toc.. and he lifted the cooler lid and cracked a beer... &nbsp;<br>
Whew…sigh of relief..<br>
<br>
On-On north through the deep shiggy (well not deep like Just Puke shiggy but
deep shiggy for normal hares) when we found another count back to the Beer Near.
&nbsp;On-On through the grapefruit grove and like a hound on a hunt round and
round and round we went, though the grove and through the grove and through the
grove. &nbsp;On-In found the rental beer vehicle beside the chemical storage
shed deep in the grove. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
A WARNING FROM JUST THOMAS. &nbsp;*** To Wit: &nbsp;It is illegal to enter and
run through a citrus grove as you could have CANKER SPORES on your shoes thus
spreading your CANKER SPORES all around the grove. &nbsp;You can be arrested for
this.<br>
<br>
Up and down every single aisle of trees, Just Thomas was obsessed about the
legal ethics of running in a citrus grove. &nbsp;Just Thomas will learn more
about Mr. Ice later.<br>
<br>
FRB of the day was of course Snail Trail with his 9 feet long legs and DFL was
Stumbelina, whining that her heart rate was up. &nbsp;Much beer awaited the pack
and we began to drink with a passion.<br>
<br>
The circle was formed and down-downs began. &nbsp;More beer, more beer, more
beer and Dr. Anus was running circles to get everyone a fresh beer. This hound
will make a good Beermiester when its his turn as no cup ever got half empty
before he was back and refilling double fisted.<br>
<br>
Our hare Short Straw was called into the circle and did multiple down-downs for
the clever trail. &nbsp;It was well planned and well executed. &nbsp;The slower
hounds were at the finish at the same time as the FRB’s give or take two
minutes. &nbsp;Drink.. mo.. fu.. Drink.. mo.. fu.. sit on cooler. sit on
cooler…<br>
<br>
Korean hashers did down downs, </font></font></b></font><b><font color="#000000" face="Arial" lang="0" family="SANSSERIF" size="3">masturbators</font><font face="arial,helvetica" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" lang="0" FAMILY="SANSSERIF">,
50% rule.. when our RA noticed that it was time for an impromptu naming. &nbsp;Just
Jacques was pale and fading again.. when he was called into the circle and
spontaneously named &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;. &nbsp;We agreed that this was
his 3rd hash but due to special circumstances.. he should be named now, &nbsp;and
QUICK..<br>
<br>
The circle was in full swing when a truck was heard coming through the grove.
&nbsp;Some hound yelled POLICE and like piss ants the hounds ran, beers in hand,
through the grove in 360 degrees. &nbsp;An Atom bomb could not have scattered
people further or faster. &nbsp;&nbsp;Over trees, under trees, diving for cover.
&nbsp;When who arrived but… THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. &nbsp;Yes,
our worst flour throwing nightmares had come true. &nbsp;In a single bound,
Krusty Kream and Sperm Aid leapt the entire chemical storage building and hugged
the corrugated metal siding.<br>
<br>
Our hare of the day Short Straw was left standing beside the rental beer vehicle
with our own Bike Bitch-Fauchitis &nbsp;(in his new leather choker that says
BITCH). &nbsp;This was a scene out of deliverance. &nbsp;Two men in an orange
grove .. one wearing a leather choker on his neck that says BITCH.<br>
<br>
Mr. Environmental Protection Agent, confused and seeing heads pop up and around
and under trees and bushes said the magic words we all had hoped for &quot;All
ya’ll hashers?&quot;, &nbsp;&quot;I used to be a Hasher&quot;. &nbsp;Sweeter
words were never spoken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After chit chatting about his days in
the Hash, he said we were illegally trespassing and to clean up when were done.
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Our songmeiser led us in Swing-Low, the RA blessed the Bar-Men… and hash no 72
came to a close. &nbsp;It was a hell of a hash with much fun and laughter and a
totally cool Environmental Protection Agent. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Much thanks to Short Straw and those that helped…<br>
Until next time…<br>
<br>
May the Hash Go in Peace.<br>
