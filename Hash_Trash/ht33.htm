Hash #33<br>
Hoosier's Over the Hill Hash<br>
Hares: Red Hot Anal Pepper and Moaner Boner<br>
Weather: 69+6 degrees with sun and cloud mix<br>
<br>
Well, we finally had good weather for a hash and it's only right since we were celebrating
Hoosier Daddy's 40th birthday. The pack met in the Symetrics parking lot on Nasa Blvd. and
after waiting for our guest of honor to finally show up (and another over the hiller, Mt.
Dora) a chalk talk was given to our many virgins. They were warned this was going to be a
fun, off-road hash with many beer stops - hey, this is Hoosier's birthday after all. Then
the pack was off. As I was a hare, I do not know the &quot;on trail&quot; dirt, but I do
know the first 1/3 of the trail wound around in some woods off Nasa, crossed Gateway and
Evans roads and ended with a beer stop behind Circles of Care. This hare, I will admit,
did a poor job of parking the beer truck and a few of the more observant hounds found a
short cut to the beer. Oh well.The rule of the beer stops was the pack had to hold until
the birthday girls showed up.&nbsp; Hoosier and Mt. Dora finally came in and after they
slammed a quick beer the pack was off again. This part of the trail had a little more
shiggy including a slippery ditch crossing and a false creek crossing. Red Hot and I were
waiting with the beer at the second beer stop and saw the first group of hounds come in
with wet tennis shoes and scratches.they were the ones who fell for the false creek
crossing (high-five co-hare!). The third third of the trail was short and sweet, although
I did find out a few of the hounds forgot to pay close attention and almost ended up
redoing part of the trail. After everyone, including Just Jesse the Dog, were in and had a
beer or two, the circle was called to order by GM Yanksit. First ones on the ice were the
hares and their trail was given a BIG thumbs up - like that was uncertain! - Okay, maybe
that is shameless bragging, but deal with it, it is one of the perks of being the on-sec.
Next on the ice were the birthday people and we had quite a few of them including Hoosier
Daddy, Mt. Dora - who both turned 40 and Just Mike who turned 25. There was a little
trouble getting them all on the ice and Hoosier had a lot of trouble keeping her beer
down. Is this one of the perils of getting old? Another couple on the ice were the
newly-weds Sperm Burp and Chipendale. Sir Flatulot presided over their hashing vows which
had a lot to do with oral sex - from Sir Flatulot? Who would have thought. Cum Chum was on
the ice for too long between and it started a hairy butt contest.there are just some
things I REALLY do not need to see! He won, by the way. The virgins were next in the
circle including Just Jesse the dog.who sat on the ice and did a down-down of water. The
out of towners came into the circle and did their required down-downs. And there were
probably more, but the beer and lack of note taking has left me clueless.oh well. I do
remember the funniest version of Swing Low I have ever heard, courtesy of Chipendale.a one
legged pollak version. You really had to see and hear that one to believe it. With the
circle closed the pack chowed down on real food and finished the beer. It was a great
trail (shameless bragging again) and a fun circle and I hope Hoosier and Mt. Dora survive
getting old!<br>
On-out, Moaner Boner, On-Sec<br>
