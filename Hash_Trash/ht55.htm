On Dec 22nd the troops gathered at Murdock&#146;s Bistro in Cocoa Village for the 55th
BVDH3 Hash. &nbsp;We were a bit shy of folk as many had escaped the sands of Brevard
county to visit family in far away places. &nbsp;Those that remained arrived in
appropriate Santa caps, lights, beads, bells, horns and bangles (Secret Santa gifts tucked
away under their arms). <br>
<br>
At the time of arrival, we were met on the street by our GM Emeritus Kojak making the
deliveries of our new BVD shirts and tanks. &nbsp;They look good and are a heavy weight
made to last!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
After a few rounds and holiday chatter, our hares Yanksit and Fireindahole offered an
abbreviated chalk talk (chalk is over there, give us 5 minutes) and they were on out - BVD
2nd Analversary Jingle Balls had begun.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The hounds were split south and east following trail that all led to El Charro Mexican
restaurant for our first beer stop. &nbsp;(Hell we should have had dinner, the joint
smelled great). &nbsp;Fifteen minutes later the troops were on-out again this time through
the village and onto Brevard Avenue to the Paradise Café. &nbsp;More beer and gawks from
passers by at the 15-20 odd Santa&#146;s swilling beer on the street. (Hide your eyes
kids). <br>
<br>
It is worthy of mention that just Marilyn entertained the hash with &quot;Mini-Bike
Bitch&quot; to hash along as (Bike Bitch in Absentia). &nbsp;The poor fool was poked,
iced, fed beer and sodomized sufficiently to do Bike Bitch proud. &nbsp;MBB is now part of
the Huya (don&#146;t touch it - those stains aren&#146;t pretty). &nbsp;Fu*kleberry
retains the Huya until another hash. <br>
<br>
The trail ended where it had begun back at Murdock&#146;s back deck. &nbsp;Bloody Ho
ending up as FRB (yes, you heard it right). &nbsp;The circle gathered and down downs,
drink, laughter, libation and much song compliments of The Original Ho.. Edgar Allen Ho
himself. &nbsp;We had three virgins whose names escaped me and we welcomed visitors 9 Year
Hard On and Chaps My Ass &nbsp;from Savannah. <br>
<br>
When the accusations were complete, we welcomed the new mis-management to town, bid
hashwell and thanks to the outgoing positions and our new Song Mistress I.F.H. led us in
Swing Low.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Number 55 was a most excellent hash (thank you hares). &nbsp;We all drank, ate, sang and
did the things that liberty and our American way of life afford us. &nbsp;As this year
fades from sight and 2002 comes in like a lion, may you all have a safe and loving
holiday! <br>
<br>
&quot;May the hash &nbsp;-and 2001- go in peace&quot;. &nbsp;-- &nbsp;Suckulater (On-Sec) </strong></font>
