<p align="center">March 2 &#150; 4, 2001</p>

<p align="center">Daytona Beach, FL</p>

<p>All you cool hasher who were there know, but for the wankers (and I heard some lame
excuses why y&#146;all couldn&#146;t make it &#150; I think one of the hashers from BVD
said something about going to Washington DC to get laid) who just couldn&#146;t make it to
Daytona this year, you missed a GREAT time!</p>

<p>The festivities started Friday afternoon on the pool deck of the Mayan Inn when the
beer truck arrived and the kegs were tapped. All evening long hashers kept arriving from
all over the country and gathered to drink some BEER! This went on, along with
registration and t-shirt selling (by the way there were some really cool goodies in the
bags and awesome t-shirt designs, especially the one by No Blow) until the cries of on-out
were heard at around 9:30. The first pub crawl of 2001 Bike Week was under way. The first
stop was Thor the Wanker&#146;s house. After a bit of drinking and socializing, the pack
was off to Robbie O&#146;Connels for more beer. The next stop was J&#146;s where the pack
continued to drink more beer. Do you see a pattern going on here? Eventually, I think most
of the hashers found their way back to the Mayan.</p>

<p>Saturday morning started with beer flowing on the pool deck and a room crawl where
bloody marys and space juice were served. One wonderful hasher even had a concoction of
coconut rum and pineapple juice&#133;that was YUMMY! Soon it was time to gather on the
upper pool deck for the hash wedding on Benyae and Rear Buccaneer. The bride was attired
in a royal blue dress with a picture hat and veil. The groom had boxer shorts and a
jacket. The brides maid was in green and the best man was in a giraffe t-back (don&#146;t
ask, it was Thor). After a quick beer, it was time to be off for DBH3 run number 569!</p>

<p>As the pack wound its way out of the hotel it was held up so all the hashers could run
down Main Street together. This is always one of the highlights of Bike Week&#133;all the
traffic stopped and us being the center of attention. Bikers were hooting and hollering
and taking pictures of us! I just love making an ass of myself ! The trail kept going and
going, full of false trails and checks, but after miles and miles and miles we finally
made it to the first beer stop. (Supposedly we were warned that the trail would be 4
&#150; 5 miles, but what hasher reads stuff like that?!) The hashers all filed into the
Love Bar for a number of brews. Then it was on-out again and this time to Sir.
Flatulot&#146;s house. After that it was just a short walk to the next stop, some
hotel&#146;s pool deck. We did have one BVDer get pretty seriously injured on this
portion. Cock Pit fell down and broke her cooter. Good thing Paddle Me is a nurse and
fixed her up a cooter sling. At this bar we also did a sorta circle where the various hash
groups were awarded down downs. After this, the group wandered back to the Mayan where
they were on their own to do what ever for the night. Beer was still flowing freely on the
pool deck of the Mayan. In fact, it was flowing so freely they actually ran out for a bit!
</p>

<p>Sunday morning was a slow one for a lot of hashers. It was a little rainy and over
cast, but we gathered on the pool deck to drink beer anyway (Bike Week actually went
through 14 kegs of beer and 10 cases!). After a while we were off on the hang over hash.
Fortunately Thor was nicer this time and we only had a very short way to go to the first
beer stop. After a while there, we went to Bernkastles for beer and food and an end to
Bike Week 2001! </p>
