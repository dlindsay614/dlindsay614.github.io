<p>BVD H3 hash #13 started out the Memorial Day weekend in the proper fashion&#133;dressed
as tacky tourists. We filtered into Long Doggers with our Hawaiian shirts, white socks
with sandals, cameras and Mickey attire, virtually taking over Long Doggers&#146; circular
porch. A bitchy, claustrophobic waitress kept telling us to clear the entrance for
customers (Who the hell do we think we are anyway? Certainly not paying customers!) We had
a quick chalk talk and headed out, rather slowly, on our dead hare trail. Our first beer
stop was at Mullet &amp; Hoosier Daddy&#146;s house. We were there only long enough to
irritate the neighbors ever so slightly. We were on-out again, weaving in and out of
housing areas and found a second beer stop behind a strip mall. We headed out for the
final leg of the trail and soon found BEER NEAR at Kojak&#146;s gutted house. Though his
home is currently under construction, the pool was sparkling clean and warm&#133;very
enticing to 28 sweaty hashers. We gathered round for the down-downs. First, we drank to
the hares and then the virgins. Next, a whole bunch of other lucky bastards drank
down-downs (I stopped taking notes about this time since I was spending time on the ice
myself for various infractions). I do know that Blowfish gave the HUYA to Assbackwards to
slow him down on the next hash. We also named Just Hana &quot;Cop Cum&quot; since
she&#146;s a 911 Operator in Melbourne. Once the circle ended, we indulged in food, drink,
and FUN!! The BBQ feast was awesome with our very own GM, Kojak, behind the grill, wearing
nutting but an apron. Harriettes in bikinis popped out from everywhere and the pool
instantly became the happenin place to be. A couple of our men hashers amused themselves
with a pool fart game. As darkness fell, so did the bathing suits&#133;and the rest
I&#146;ll leave for yawl to brag, gossip, rumor, or whatever trips your trigger. For those
who missed BVD H3 hash #13&#133; bummer! Not to worry though&#133;this hash won&#146;t be
fizzling out anytime soon. On-Out!</font>
