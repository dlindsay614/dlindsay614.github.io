<p>TOGA, TOGA, TOGA!!! In my not so professional hasher opinion, I&#146;d swear that we
get more attention in Togas than we do on a red dress hash! Though the day started out
wet, our Religious Advisor, Yanksit, promptly called for a dry hash, and so it was. A
rather small, but rowdy bunch of BVDers flowed into the Crazy Parrot, sporting Togas. The
owner of the Crazy Parrot welcomed us and said that we reminded him of his college days.
After an hour or so at the Parrot, we headed out to find trail on this live hare hash. As
we expected, the trail led us on a pub crawl through Cocoa Beach. Our first stop was
Johnathon&#146;s Pub and then the Fun Time Bar. Our third stop was at the Inner Room
&quot;Titty&quot; Bar where Yanksit was asked to leave. Yes, I must explain. You see,
generally speaking, one does not wear undergarments with a Toga, at least not Yanksit. Red
Hot Anal Pepper decided to spice things up a bit for our topless dancers by lifting
Yanksit&#146;s Toga, exposing his buttocks. &quot;The Management&quot; (bouncer)
didn&#146;t like that so much and said he couldn&#146;t be in the bar without any shorts
or &quot;something&quot; on. I guess it&#146;s okay for the employees to be naked, but not
the paying customer. Anyway, when Yanksit left, most of us followed him out (some stayed
to finish their beer&#151;right!). Our next and last stop was a BEER NEAR at the beach. We
circled up for the traditional down-downs. The first went to our Grand Master, Kojak, for
not wearing a toga. Next, a new BVDer named Roadmap took a seat on the ice and drank. Dick
Long &amp; Perspire and Just Laura did down-downs for something I can&#146;t recall. Next
were the hares. Assbackwards was given special attention since this was his last
hash&#151;he&#146;s moving to Georgia. Ass was given a beer mug and a framed picture of
two moons (his and Yanksit&#146;s in red dresses!). We&#146;re really going to miss our
first BVD H3 Beermeister! Next, we named Just Katie &quot;I&#146;d Fuck Her.&quot; I
don&#146;t think I need to say anything else bout that. Red Hot did a down down for taking
on Beermeister duties. FRBs (no kidding) Kojak and Red Hot drank, then Yanksit and Red Hot
for getting kicked out of the titty bar. Just Ted sat upon the ice form sumthin and
finally, Butt Wrangler and Turd Burglar sat on ice for using their wanker names. As a
final note, I&#146;d like to mention that our HUYA owner, Bitch Be Gone, failed to show up
at this toga hash&#133;hmmm&#133;I wonder who&#146;ll be nominated for the HUYA next?</font>
