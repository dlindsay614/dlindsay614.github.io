<br>
It was a bright, clear and glorious day for a change as we gathered at<br>
the Mel Beach Pubelix. About 30 hardy souls appeared dressed<br>
appropriately to help with the celebration. Well, almost. One Harrier<br>
who &quot;has no blue or pink&quot; chose to put some kinda pinkish colored stuff<br>
on his hair. Looked to me like a big bird that had been feeding in a<br>
blackberry patch took a dump on his goldilocks. <br>
<br>
Hash Standard Start time turned into let's wait another five minutes for<br>
Sir Flatulot from Daytona, he said he'd be here. Five more and five<br>
more and....the bastard finally appeared, there was chalk talk and the<br>
pack was off. <br>
<br>
Now, when trail is in Mel. Beach you know you're gonna go north or south<br>
cause there ain't much east/west. So, after running around the big<br>
parking lot for a bit the trail was finally found to go north on A1A. <br>
Finally it turned east down onto the beach. Ahhh, visions of a day of<br>
dry feet for a change suddenly disappeared as the tide was high and the<br>
waves booming up to the dunes. The going was tough in the wet deep sand<br>
and some runners not experienced with timing the waves found out what<br>
it's like to get slammed and drenched against the steep dunes. Right<br>
GM? Our southerly course just kept going and going like that other<br>
bunny until the FRB's were beginning to mentally practice their Spanish.<br>
South Beach had to be close, but the BN appeared for the halfway stop to<br>
everyone's joy. The run then continued back across the highway into the<br>
park. Now there's basically only one trail in that park but the Hares<br>
laid some pretty tricky checks that did keep the pack guessing and<br>
pretty much together. Then back across the highway and BN appeared<br>
again. It looked suspiciously like the first spot (it was) and we<br>
gathered for a few brews before the GM called the circle in a gorgeous<br>
space above the pounding surf surrounded by sea grapes, blue sky and the<br>
setting sun to the west. Awesome spot! <br>
<br>
A toast to G and our 50th (hey, that's great gang) started the<br>
festivities. Much butt kissed the ice so I'll try to keep to the<br>
highlights. Gas Ass from Pikes Peak H3 and Garfield from Austin H3<br>
spent a long time sitting. I'm sure they got to phase 4. Gas Ass was<br>
released but Garfield was asked to remain to have a brew with those who<br>
attended Interam. As the down-down commenced the four Hashers in the<br>
circle with him poured their beers all over him. RA announced that this<br>
was our little way of getting even with Austin for the absolutely<br>
ghastly St. Arnold's Lawnmower lager PISS they foisted on the masses who<br>
visited Austin. Poor Garfield wasn't even at that event - too bad. <br>
(Hey Flatch I knew you were at Austin, I was just kiddin.)<br>
<br>
Ass Gas commented to me that this was the first time he had seen the ice<br>
thing. Well, yeah, if your from Colorado it would be like bringing an<br>
ice cube to a snow making party.<br>
<br>
Several visitors were called in. Two from the Spaced Coast Biko Sykos<br>
who had been invited by Surf and Sky Box. Guess who didn't appear. <br>
We'll get ya next time guys.<br>
<br>
And then there were three namings.<br>
<br>
Just Gabe was baptized ASS SQUEALER.<br>
<br>
The main event (well not quite), Just Shoe, after much deliberation and<br>
far too much anticipation beforehand, was baptized BIKE BITCH. <br>
<br>
(Authors note: perhaps members of Mismanagement should treat namings in<br>
the future kinda like our Pres., secret, need-to-know basis. WS please<br>
pay attention.)<br>
<br>
And then there was Jean-Ann or &quot;Star&quot; as she WAS fondly known. She told<br>
me beforehand that Orlando (don't know which one) tried to name her last<br>
week but she refused cause she wanted BVD to name her. Thank you ya<br>
bunch a wimps it was our PLEASURE. Star came to us some time ago and I<br>
think the reaction was pretty general among the Harriers. Good lookin,<br>
outgoing, cocky, fun, great buns. But, something was missing. Oh, I<br>
guess it was that two raisins on a bread board look below her chin. <br>
Well, thanks to the science of saline and the skill of the surgeon all<br>
has been made well. And she showed them to the boys proudly. WOW. And<br>
people ask this old fart why he keeps hashing, HA. And so after a great<br>
deal of thinking by the group &quot;Star&quot; was baptized SALT LICK TITTY.<br>
<br>
A hearty welcome to the Hash you three.<br>
<br>
As the sun was setting visitor Sir Flatulot was invited to lead us in<br>
Swing Low. Thanks Flatch, good job. (is he really a visitor, he's here<br>
almost as much as he is in Daytona.)<br>
<br>
And thanks to the Hares, well done and good luck with the pregnancy.<br>
<br>
And then we were off to Bike Bitch's place for the ON AFTER. Potty and<br>
Trott Twat took a shower that lasted about an hour. And later they<br>
apparently gave the springs in the guest room a workout. What's with<br>
those two? And there were others. Must have been the sesame seeds in<br>
the pizza.<br>
<br>
ON OUT<br>
