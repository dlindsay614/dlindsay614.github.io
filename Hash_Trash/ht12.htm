<p>To the surprise of R.J Gator&#146;s management, a loud, beer-drinking group took over
the bar during Happy Hour for hash #12&#146;s on-before. Soon, though, the group was
on-out for a quick chalk talk. Being a dead hare trail, the hounds headed out immediately,
on across busy Wickham Rd. They followed a path along a dyke, jumped across it and took a
short jaunt through a housing area and the Brevard Community College campus (Yanksit ran
into a curious campus security guard earlier that day when laying trail and told him the
group would be cumming through around 2:00&#151;HEE HEE! We don&#146;t start till 4:00ish
for those who don&#146;t get it or weren&#146;t there.) The trail went off-road into
Wickham Park where the group ran/walked a couple of miles before cumming up on the beer
stop. Because it was such a hot day, the FRBs were more than happy to lounge around, and
drink a beer or two while waiting on the SWBs. The hounds headed out through more nature
trails, the park&#146;s recreation area, and finally another woodsy/sandy trail to find
the BEER NEAR and the hares in a secluded part of the park. Hoosier Daddy and Party Hats
short-cutted part of the trail and found their way to the end before most of the FRBs!
Unfortunately, three of our hashers (Red Hot Anal Pepper, Just Hana, and a female virgin)
got lost on trail, finding us much later&#151;accident? Cum on now, Red Hot with two young
females in the woods&#151;lost my ass! The down-downs were next and we had a lot of people
to honor. They included: Assbackwards for a zit on his nose, the hares, Pocket Rocket for
his blue jean sweaty groin area, Party Hats for too long between hashes (our hash harlot
rubbed her &quot;cooter&quot; on ice!), Sperm Burp &amp; Mullet on ice for various reasons
(my notes don&#146;t make sense), newlyweds Without Socks and Just Katie, Spermaid on ice
for a special-made hat, Assbackwards on ice for his private party with Itchy Cajons,
Moaner Boner on ice for worrying the BVD H3 hash #12 would be cancelled, Butt Wrangler for
whining, Kojak &amp; Butt Wrangler for their bald heads, 10 virgins and 5 visitors (this
is when Red Hot &amp; females friends found the circle). Tumbalina gave the HUYA to
Blowfish for being a pain in her ass (I think that&#146;s my interpretation). Our two
Swedish girls, Hana &amp; her virgin, did down-downs for cumming in late with Red Hot.
Finally, Turd Burglar and Edgar Allen Ho sat on ice for yaeger meister (??) and I have no
clue what that means! The on-after for some was back to R.J. Gators for food and beverage
and others headed to Mullet and Hoosier Daddy&#146;s love palace. That&#146;s it for now.
May beer be with you! </font>
