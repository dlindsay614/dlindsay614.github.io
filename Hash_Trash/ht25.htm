Well, the BVD H3's first Hashoween together started out as any other hash day, with the
exception of some unusual visitors. We had a geisha girl (MoanerBoner), a King wearing
Grandma's couch (Mullet), a Kung Fu Fighter (Red Hot Anal Pepper), a jester ( Sir
Flatulot...surely you jest), a pimp (Turd Burglar), Skipper, Gilligan &amp; Mrs. Howell
(Without Socks, I'd Fuck Her, and just Laura)--they made it off the island just in time
for our Hashoween, the Pope (Yanksit, our honorable Religious Advisor was promoted ), Red
Riding Hood (Cockpit...she begged the wolf to eat her, but to no avail), Dr. Evil with Mr.
Bigglesworth (Cum Chum), Swiss Miss (Cop Cum), Pussy Cat (Fireindahole), Zorro?
(Gilligan), Sailor Girl with itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini (Herecterpad), Little Devil
with glowing horns (Hoosier Daddy), Skeleton (Kojak), G.I. Hasher (Just Puke), Cave Woman
(Just Jen), a cowboy (Just Eric), and a beautiful purple butterfly (Litterbox). That
leaves Potty Flavor and Just Hillary-My memory failed me and I can't remember your
costumes-so sorry!<br>
Starting from the beachside E.G. Edwards on HW 192, we made our way slowly across the
causeway. We received a lot of honks and cheers from the passing cars. Yanksit was quite
concerned that people would mistake him for a KKK member instead of the Pope until he
walked passed an African American fishing off the causeway. As Yanksit approached, the
fisherman said, &quot;Hey John Paul.&quot; After that he relaxed and offered the
traditional Pope cupped-hand wave to the cars going by. On the other side of the causeway,
our hare, Sir Flatulot, had hidden a cooler full of beer in a park. We drew strange looks
from people in the park as we scoured the bushes looking for the treasured nectar. Finding
it, we settled down at a picnic table for a break. From there, the trail took us through
the ever popular BVD H3 party hang-out, Old Downtown Melbourne. People were already
starting to gather for the Megoween Street party. Speaking of Meg O' Malleys, we took a
short detour through the packed bar. The band had stopped and commented on the costumes as
we paraded through. We had a déjà vu experience as we headed out of town, and up to HW 1
in the direction of the Indian River Brewery. We had a second beer stop in front of the
brewery. The hare wanted the hounds to make a quick stop inside the brewery, but
evidently, someone screwed up the plan. We were off again, wondering if the end was near.
By now, we remembered that Sir Flatulot's idea of a short, easy hash is 4-5 miles of
trail. Not whining here...just stating a fact! Butt, the end was only a half mile away in
Just Jen's backyard. She and Moaner had decorated it well with hanging lights and jack o'
lanterns carved with a foot and BVD H3. In true hashing tradition, we circled up and
awarded people with down-downs. We started with the virgins, Just Hillary &amp; Just Eric.
Just Puke offered a demonstration D-D. We had all the normal down-downs with the hare,
best costumes (everyone), and finally Just Jen was named Gamey Gonads--She's a
Veterinarian Assistant and she shared a story with Moaner about opening up a male dog and
discovering some nasty testicles. I think there's more to the story, but by this time, it
was too dark for me to take notes-I'm sure someone who reads this will help me get it
right (Moaner). With the keg gone, some of us headed down to the Megoween street party.
Yanksit had a great time hugging all the nuns and he encouraged them to get drunk and have
a good time! All said and done, BVD H3's first Hashoween was a success! <br>
