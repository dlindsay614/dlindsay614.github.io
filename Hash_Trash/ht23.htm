<p>Well, we&#146;re back to the old style of the hash trash, at least for BVD H3&#146;s 23<sup>rd</sup>
hash. I meant to ask for cumments again since everyone seemed to enjoy the change of pace,
but I got so caught up in the ambience at the end&#133;but wait I&#146;m getting aHEAD of
myself! What a glorious hash day and it was Red Hot Anal Pepper&#146;s birthday to boot!
&quot;Happy Birthday, Fuck You!&quot; Crotch Duster popped in from Texas and blessed us
with his presence&#151;we&#146;ve missed you man! It was his 34<sup>th</sup> birthday,
along with 40Wanks. Ironically, Red Hot turned 43. During the chalk talk, our hare, Red
Hot, explained that a circle with an &quot;XC&quot; in the middle marked various Extra
Credit &quot;watering holes&quot; along the trail, should the pack decide to stop in to
wet their whistles. Well, we were on-out and it didn&#146;t take us long to find the first
stop, even though it wasn&#146;t marked XC or otherwise (this was extra, extra credit).
So, we were on-in to Big Al&#146;s bar, on-out and on-in to another bar that looked like
someone&#146;s renovated Victorian-style home. Next, we headed out through the streets of
Old Melbourne, and once again took an extra credit stop at a dockside bar. We entertained
the locals for awhile and then we made our way up to US 1. Low and behold&#133;could we be
heading toward the Indian River Brewery? You bet your ass we were! For the second time,
the BVD H3 ended our hash is this sacred place&#151;and they gave us the key to lock it up
when we were through&#133;they don&#146;t know us too well, do they? We had the circle
among the monstrous vats filled to the brim with hash nectar. The down-downs started out
with our hare, Red Hot, then the virgins, Just Louis, Just Chris, and Just Lisa. Crotch
Duster was next for too long between hashes and 40 Wanks joined Crotch and Red Hot in the
circle for a birthday song. Next we sang to the October birthdays&#151;Herectorpad and
Just Lisa. We named Just Tom, Just Puke. Rumor has it he attended a posh museum toga
party, got trashed, and proceeded to puke on everything in sight. Down-downs continued
with Just Tom and Just Louis competing for the speediest gulp&#133;twice. I don&#146;t
remember who &quot;won.&quot; Then we honored our visitors, 40 Wanks and Gilligan, Mullet
for recommending the third extra credit stop and then hurrying us out because he
didn&#146;t want to be late for the show &quot;Grease&quot; he was attending later that
evening. More D-D&#146;s for Bitch Be Gone (FRB), Without Sock &amp; I&#146;d Fuck Her for
something&#151;I can&#146;t read my writing, but it looks like &quot;first beer.&quot;
Accusations were flying all over the place and Herectorpad was spotted wearing new shoes.
She, of course, drank from her shoe. After a few presents for Red Hot, we were on-out to
the on-after, Vallartes Mexican Restaurant on Babcock. This is our second on-after at this
fine establishment and I can say they serve good food and easily tolerate and welcome a
bunch of loud, drunken hashers. Daytona, here we cum!! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
