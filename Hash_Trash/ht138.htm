&quot;Trail, What Trail !!&quot;<br>
<br>
</b></font><font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>Okay, I would like to just 
volunteer myself to do Hash Trash for this<br>
wonder of a Foot Hash... I will need a list of names, and a co-author,<br>
to complete this beauty, cause I don't want to leave anyone out.<br>
<br>
It only has to be 10% true, but I think I am actually 75% on this one<br>
(cause I am missing a side)... If anyone disagrees... Well.......<br>
<br>
Hares:<br>
<br>
Moo Goo Guy Hand &amp; Just Ken<br>
<br>
Chalk Talk:<br>
<br>
Goo starts it with the most icons in Chalk Talk history. This sparked<br>
much interest and the group became excited. There was some confusion as<br>
to what some of the symbols were, but Goo assured us that it was pretty<br>
straight forward.....<br>
<br>
The Trail:<br>
<br>
Hares away... YAY... 15 minutes and we get to experience this amazing<br>
wonder laid by Goo and Just Ken.... Holy Shit, can this actually be<br>
happening???<WBR>....<br>
Yes it can... Within the first 500 yards the trail is lost... Harriers<br>
are scrambling to find the elusive flour clump... How clever...<br>
One trail leads us into an apartment complex, yet there are no other<br>
marks anywhere to be found... How F'in awesome!!! The whistle blows in<br>
the distance... &quot;On-On&quot; a hasher calls out, so once again, we follow<br>
along.... We make our way down a canal and continued on our way through<br>
the rugged out back. We come to a safe crossing (on a baron road) and<br>
head into the deep dark woods.... As we make our way through, following<br>
the well marked trail, we come to a</b></font><font size="3" face="arial,helvetica"><b>n 
orange tape marked palm branch...<br>
Where does it lead???? We all decide to play detective, so we search the<br>
immediate area. Hashers are everywhere..<WBR>. No sign of the trail... &quot;ARE<br>
YOU?&quot; is heard back in the woods... &quot;LOOKING!&quot;, is shouted back... The<br>
heat is on... no trail in this area, but there are about 15 cat bowls<br>
lined up along the curb... is this a new way of marking trail? NO!<br>
At this point Slow Poker and myself are still sleuthing... while,<br>
apparently, someone found the trail... (at this point someone will need<br>
to fill in those notes).<br>
<br>
I Feel Pretty and Slow Poker's Journey:<br>
As we search the cat bowl area, we realize, we are alone.... no trail,<br>
no hashers. (seriously, someone else needs to chime in on the details of<br>
the other part... like a Quentin Tarantino movie shit got all F'd up at<br>
this point)<br>
Poker and I try to find some sign of of life... In the distance we hear<br>
whistles, but can't quite seem to target their whereabouts. As we make<br>
our way about 3 miles east of the trail, we find ourselves standing in a<br>
basketball court and there is still no sign of anyone. Now there are no<br>
whistles and no trail... we are officially lost!!! We make our way into<br>
the woods via a pre-laid dirt trail... As we follow, I yell out, &quot;there<br>
are tracks!!&quot;, Poker replies, &quot;those are animal&quot;. In fact they were...<br>
Boar tracks to be exact... can't wait to see if we come across this<br>
wondrous beast. We continue on our journey still no sound, still no<br>
trail, so we begin to head in a more southerly direction; back to the<br>
main road. As we are heading out, we see trail marks... COOL!!! We are<br>
ON ON! Wait.... The trail is behind us, so now we must turn around and<br>
follow the actual trail. Yes!!! We were finally on trail.. This was such<br>
an awesome feeling. As Poker and I were talking about the group doing<br>
circle at this point and hoping there would still be beer left we<br>
followed trail for about another 3 miles..... We finally came to a canal<br>
crossing that , I'm sorry even as a Fl boy, I will NOT cross..... Poker<br>
and I devise a plan to find concrete again to try to regroup... After<br>
about another mile in the thick, we do find concrete... We see that we<br>
are actually about a mile from where we started still, so we just start<br>
heading that way hoping that we will cross trail or even some Hashers.<br>
<br>
Two Hours In:<br>
<br>
At this point we are F'in tired.... walkin down some road, wondering<br>
where the hell we are, or if we will ever see our families again....<br>
Poker gathers up the breath to say.... &quot;anytime now, Goo will come<br>
driving by in his truck to pick us up&quot;... As if he were seeing some F'in<br>
mirage... In the distance we see headlights..<WBR>.. They grow closer....<br>
There are people in the car... They are waving... It's F'in Goo!!!!<br>
YAY!!!!! We are saved!!!!! We jump in the truck.. Get a ride (about 4<br>
miles back) to circle and, wait.... no one is there accept us.... Where<br>
are all the hashers?? Did we miss circle???<br>
<br>
NO!!! NO ONE FINISHED!!!! All hashers went to the wrong finishing point<br>
(cause Vagina Miner (signed and sealed) gave the wrong directions to<br>
circle). When it came time for circle, no one even gave the trail the<br>
honor of shitty trail, or sang the shitty trail song... Hashers were<br>
speechless..<WBR>. Some left and went home or rock-wall climbing....<WBR>.....<br>
This truly sucked... I can guarantee you that there is a different story<br>
for each person on the trail, cause we all lost each other!!!!<br>
<br>
On-F'in- Off!!!!<br>
<br>
Disclaimer:<br>
<br>
This is the story of IFP and Slow Poker, most events are true.. the<br>
names have not been changed to protect the innocent cause Goo and Just<br>
Ken are F'in guilty of Suck-ass trail laying… Everyone keep this<br>
in mind when naming Just Ken… ;)<br>
