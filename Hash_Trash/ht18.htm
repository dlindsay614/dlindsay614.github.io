<p>I&#146;m starting to believe there&#146;s a connection between hash days and the rain.
I&#146;m definitely not whining, just stating a fact. Besides, it&#146;s actually much
cooler to hash in the rain than on a bright, sunny, Florida summer day. At the start of
this particular BVD H3 hash, #18 to be exact, the hounds turned out slowly at first. Butt
before long, we had twenty-some hounds raring to go. Our live hares, Yanksit and Red Hot,
were appropriately baptized with a sprinkling of beer before they took off to lay the
trail. The antsy hounds gave them a whole 15 minutes of lead time before they were hot on
the trail. The pack weaved through some urban trail for the first couple of miles. After
crossing a very busy US Hwy 1, we headed south&#133;some hounds more slowly than others
(including me). This fact was observed by a friendly Melbourne police officer in his
patrol car. He announced over his speaker as we passed by, &quot;You&#146;re supposed to
run, not walk.&quot; Well, it turns out this &quot;helpful&quot; officer is a hasher and
joined us later at the end of his shift. Back to the trail. We headed on-in to a wooded
area, then on-across the railroad tracks for more woodsy trail. After about a mile or so
of this scenic trail, we heard the FRBs celebrating at the end of the trail. We hurried
out of the woods to find the BN (beer near) and everyone gathered on a clearing in the
woods, next to a dyke. Just as we formed the circle for our traditional down-downs, we
heard some late cummers yelling &quot;ON-ON.&quot; It turned out to be two Orlando
hashers, Skin a Max &amp; Lick Her Kick Her. These two DFL (dead fuckin last) hashers
started out the circle on the ice. Next, the hares sat on ice. Pocket Rocket&#146;s
birthday was honored with his ass on ice and a lovely verse of &quot;Happy Birthday, Fuck
You.&quot; We recognized three new BVD H3 virgins, Just Jen, Just Will and Hose Drip.
Moaner Boner and Yanksit ended up sharing the ice for awhile. Yanksit then called Sky Box
and Surf to the circle to recognize this hash as their hash-aversay. From what we
understand, one year ago, on this same trail, they consummated their hash life. Edgar
Allen Ho gave the HUYA to I&#146;d Fuck Her. Rationale: He&#146;d fuck her (now really,
who wouldn&#146;t??). Accusations flew and all those who were without beer attire in
support of this hash's theme, Beers Around the World, did down-downs. By this time, the
50% rule applied and everyone who hadn&#146;t been in the circle was called in. Oddly
enough, with only 26 hounds and hares present, we floated the keg shortly after the end of
the circle. With the night still young, we headed for the All American Bar on US 1. For
those of us who had never visited this fine establishment, it turned out to be a hasher
paradise&#133;cheap, cold beer by the pitcher, a pool table, and a juke box full of rock
n&#146; roll . We mixed right in with the locals, and had one helluva good time! </font>
