Hash #32<br>
Date: February 3, 2001<br>
Hares: Just Puke and Yanksit<br>
Place: RJ Gator's<br>
Weather: 69-4 degrees and cloudy<br>
<br>
Well, we had another cloudy, cold day for hashing, but that didn't deter many.&nbsp; There
was quite a crowd around the bar at RJ Gator's, where we met for a few brews before
heading out on trail to experience Just Puke's Virgin Lay.&nbsp; There were about 5 virgin
hashers among us, so after a chalk talk and a fun Father Abraham, the pack was off on this
pre-laid trail. Now, I have to confess something here - I didn't do the trail. &nbsp;
Instead I jumped in a truck with a fellow autohasher and went to the mid-way to watch for
incumming hashers.&nbsp; After a while (I guess that means the first half of the trail was
long) they started staggering in.&nbsp; Just Bernadette came in bloody and the others came
in sweaty and looking for a beer.&nbsp; After a few minutes of relaxing and drinking, the
pack was off again for the second half of the trail.&nbsp; Okay, I have to confess again,
I didn't do the second half of the trail either.&nbsp; As one of the hares, another
autohasher and I waited at the end, we saw Without Sock and Edgar Allen Ho cum in first;
dirty, scratched and definitely in need for a beer or 10.&nbsp; The others were not too
far behind, although I did notice the last group came in much less dirty - shortcutting,
maybe?&nbsp; Way to go! Our GM, Yanksit, called the circle to order and he had a little
contest for us.&nbsp; As we were approaching the anniversary of the death of G, he asked
if anyone knew G's other middle name.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack was baffled, but that didn't
stop us from shouting out names as guesses.&nbsp; Gamey Gonads had the correct guess of
Ignasises and won a really cool hash shirt (which are on sale before every hash - see Red
Hot). The circle was then turned over to RA Red Hot and the beer was blessed. &nbsp; The
Hares were called to the circle and although there were some cries that their trail was
too long, it still won approval.&nbsp; Just Puke had to remain on the ice for being a
Media Slut this week.&nbsp; It seems he was at the Super Bowl and was caught on film by
Jay Leno who then used him as part of his schtick (is that how you spell that
word?).&nbsp; The story we heard was that Puke was walking with a &quot;hottie&quot; in a
bikini and Jay commented that it is always guys like him who get girls like her. &nbsp;
Cock Pit was the next on the ice for having a blond moment (or being a dumb ass) and
forgetting to put film in her camera.&nbsp; There are just too many things to remember
when you are Hash Flash!&nbsp; As Red Hot was calling on the pack again for songs, Without
Socks was on the ice for having a very weak song (you'd think he would have learned!).
&nbsp; Socks stayed on the ice and was joined by Edgar Allen Ho for being the FRBs. &nbsp;
About this time a train was heard and the circle broke up as a number of hashers couldn't
resist the opportunity to moon the train.&nbsp; Well, one of the ice-sitters made the
mistake of leaving the ice without the permission of the RA, so Ho had to do another
down-down.&nbsp; Next on the ice was Tumbalina (I never could find out why she was on
there, so I am thinking maybe I should just make something up.) for not only mooning the
train, but doing a slow, sexy strip tease as well that caused the train to derail and
pandemonium break out (is there a rule about the Hash Trash&nbsp; being true or can it be
factional fiction?).&nbsp; The next group called to the circle were the Virgins - and we
had a great group this time.&nbsp; Virgin Debbie was brought by Ball Breaker (who was
absent), Virgin Mary Bigwood (why are some people actually born with a hash name?) was
also made to cum by Ball Breaker (he's been busy!) Virgins Mike and Stazy were made to cum
by Gamey Gonads (she's been busy too!) and Virgin Eric was made to cum by Just Puke (and
to think, he had a hottie just the weekend before!).&nbsp; The Virgins and those who made
them cum (Crotch was so nice and was a stunt dick for Ball Breaker) all did a down-down
and were properly welcumed to BVD H3!&nbsp; Now, let's just see if they cum back!&nbsp;
Puke and Moaner were called to the ice and made to do an unemployed down-down (yeah, sure,
make fun of the downtrodden).&nbsp; Moaner stayed on the ice and was joined by the
autohashers who included the Hares and Red Hot and then Kojak also had to drink because if
one GM drinks, they all drink!&nbsp; Moaner had to stay on the ice again (and yes, in case
you were wondering, the ice was VERY cold - not whining, just stating a fact) while our
new Song Miester, Without Socks, serenaded her with a new song composed by him (rumor has
it that Socks will be composing a new song for each hash, check the web site).&nbsp; Next
came the accusations and HeWreckedHerPad was called to the ice for wearing more clothes
than anybody had ever seen on her.&nbsp; Crotchduster was accused of disrespect to the
circle.&nbsp; There might have been a few more, but after doing so many down-downs in a
row my handwriting has become like hieroglyphics.&nbsp; The circle was closed with
Swing-low and we piled into the trucks to make it back to the start.&nbsp; Most of the
hashers went to Crickets for the on-after and I am waiting for the report of the
shenanigans!&nbsp;&nbsp; That's it for this week!<br>
On-out, Moaner Boner, On-Sec<br>
