<br>
&quot;Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Isn't that the part about being at a hash that makes you want to be there 
anyways?<br>
It is a drinking club with a running problem, right? Maybe it's about the 
camaraderie.<br>
Or is it the game? An old man's quest for the miraculous Easter Egg (or at least 
the plop <br>
of flour that looks like an Easter Egg after you've had a few beers). <br>
For me, it's about being around a diverse group of people with one common goal.<br>
I haven't infiltrated the group deep enough to figure out what that goal is, 
but,<br>
I'm sure I'll like it once you bastards tell me what it is. A wise old man once 
told me... okay, <br>
it was an old man... (here comes the ramblings)... as I was saying, Spermaid 
once told me some<br>
time last year as I had just begun my quest for the Holy Hash, the people are 
great. Yeah, I <br>
know, he is a wise old sage (or at least the only one not quite as old a Kojak),<br>
but his words were prophetic. It's the people that makes the hash so much fun.<br>
Thank you to everyone that came out tonight. <br>
<br>
10 minutes later (at least)....<br>
<br>
We had a hash tonight! Ash Wednesday in one hand, Hash Wednesday in <br>
the other. We had a boatload at the hash tonight. You <br>
naughty, naughty hashers! Drinking beer and gallivanting through the <br>
woods on one of the five most sacred days of the year. Some new <br>
faces and old faces. Virgins, STFU (isn't that an oxymoron?) JUST <br>
KIDDING! Love ya Torrie, mean it! No Timmy tonight, Just an email <br>
that said &quot;Not Hashing tonight.&quot; Next, it was thoughts of, oh man, <br>
I'm driving really far tonight and since I am by myself, I can't <br>
drink! Problem solved, just leaving my house, I pull up behind Slow <br>
Poker and convince him to ride with me. Yeah, I can drink and since <br>
I will only have to drive two blocks home, I can drink tonight and <br>
grace the group with drunken ramblings! Off to Beef's.<br>
<br>
As I pulled in, I said to Slow Poker, &quot;I can smell it.&quot; Slow Poker says &quot;What?&quot;
<br>
I reply &quot;Spermaid, I can smell him a mile away.&quot; I knew his old ass <br>
would be there. We pull up and the group is pretty big already. I <br>
see BVDers, Lost Hares, Coasters (what else are we?) and some <br>
virgins. I get a kiss from STFU, another from Krusty, hell even <br>
Spermaid tried to get one, but, I wasn't having any of that. Kojak <br>
and Lollie are there, then Shop Teacher shows up.</b></font><p align="center">

Chalk Talk and ATC is out. He tells us which way he is heading since<br>
he is such a nice guy. Knuckle head, we're in the middle of a big parking lot.
<br>
We're hashers though and we would NEVER watch which way you take <br>
off. Walkers out, runners out, hobblers out. Across the street and <br>
right for the earthen ground. Hey Spermaid, this is the part of the <br>
Hangover Hash that I prelaid and realized it wasn't connected to our <br>
trail! Only I would lay a piece of good trail and not have it <br>
connect to actual trail. Call it practice trail I guess. Sure <br>
would throw off the rangers though. Next comes the sidewalk, back <br>
along the bike trails, more sidewalk, more canal running. We've <br>
changed directions several times and I'm not sure which direction we <br>
are going. More weaving between roads and woods with a pretty good <br>
mix. I run in and find Shop and ATC with a well laid circle. The <br>
construction crew supplied us with a port-o-let and a buffet table. <br>
They sure are nice down in Palm Bay. Spicy Doritos, fudge striped <br>
cookies, beer and water. <br>
<br>
Who went which way, Was that a count back? There was no mention of count backs<br>
in chalk talk? Lots of boob checks on trail. I didn't see any though. Tooth 
Fairy is at <br>
the start and is just starting out on trail. Circle up, To G, hare in the 
circle,<br>
virgins in the circle, visitors in the circle, same hash gear, whistle check,<br>
Spermaid asked for a pecker check, accusations all around, ATC (our hare)<br>
had to drive and get more beer. Autohashing!!!! Just Jen is about to not be Just 
Jen <br>
anymore, Slow Poker dishes all the stuff he can and somehow it all has to do 
with how<br>
anal she is. Document Whore, Fudge Packuh, Chocolate Covered Semen, and the<br>
winner is &quot;F'k Brownies, Eat a Girl Scout&quot; or F.B.E.A.G.S. for the 
acronym obsessed (<i>ed</i>).</font></b><p align="center">

&nbsp;LOOK, I can barely keep my eyes open, let alone type and remember 
everything<br>
about the night there is to remember just so Kojak and Spermaid can<br>
remember the night. If it wasn't for the Alzheimer twins, I could just go to 
bed.<br>
Its you two guy's fault I have to go home and drink more, just to bore the heck<br>
out of the group.<br>
<br>
Anyways, its time to head home, no carousing tonight. So Slow <br>
Poker, you want Chinese food or Taco Bell? Hey Snip It, How about <br>
Beefs? I thought you had to get home, Ah, it'll be all right. The <br>
food is taking forever, so we might as well drink that pitcher of <br>
beer we ordered. Yikes! Gotta go. Dropped Slow Poker off at <br>
Re/Max and took the long way home. If they would allow you to drive <br>
down the bike path, I could eliminate half of the 8 blocks I drive <br>
to work each day. A snifter of bourbon and a couple of Amberbocks <br>
and here we are.<br>
<br>
Al Bundy (of television fame) once said &quot;Pretty Women make us buy <br>
beer. UGLY women make us drink beer.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think Al is wrong. A good beer is best shared with friends. The <br>
only thing better is when you drink that beer while watching <br>
Spermaid spend 8 minutes and 22 seconds trying to figure out how to <br>
get the salt grinder to work. Priceless.<br>
<br>
On passed out,<br>
