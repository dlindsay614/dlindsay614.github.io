The BVD Kennel gathered, each hound greeting the other at the Rack Alley
Billiard Hall in Palm Bay on Saturday April 27, 2002. &nbsp;Those BVDers having
recently returned from Run-A-Muck 2002 passed stories of Campfires, Dick Tricks,
Chiggers an Apple Pie Team and the kind hospitality of our hosts MothSucker and
Studwich.<br>
<br>
Hash cash being quickly collected and a chalk talk held, our hares of the day
Just Puke and Dr. Anus on his virgin lay were on out to set up extra credits and
half way surprises. &nbsp;Watch-em-Wiggle from Palatka volunteers to drive the
beer truck this hash. &nbsp;Our haberdasher Kojak having pawned his wares to the
hounds early; pre-run business had drawn to a close. &nbsp;The impatient hounds
feeling restless ventured into the nearest drinking establishment at the Rack
Alley Billiard Hall. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now on a hot Saturday afternoon the sight of a thirsty Hash Kennel with money in
their pockets wondering in off the street would usually make a saloon owner cum
in his pants. &nbsp;Alas, this was not the case. &nbsp;As our hounds piled in
the door we were met by the &quot;Suck Alley&quot; bartender of the day; Fatfuck.
&nbsp;Fatfuck being a legal scholar squawked that we could not bring our
drinking vessels into the bar. &nbsp;Plastic drinking vessels, according to
Fatfuck, are against the law in Palm Bay. &nbsp;We reported that they were all
empty and we were here to buy beer. &nbsp;Fatfuck again grumbled that if we
drank, we would be drinking from his mugs, not ours. &nbsp;It is hard for a
single Fatfuck to scare away 17 or so hashers, so lager we did purchase and
drink. &nbsp;No tip for Fatfuck. &nbsp;Side note: &nbsp;The BVD Hash were the
sole customers in &quot;Suck Alley&quot;.<br>
Side note to owner: &nbsp;BVD hopes that the hiring of Fatfuck was not your best
business decision. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Having consumed 2 pitchers of lager in 3.5 minutes, the hounds were on out to
the kinder gentler Applebees on the southwest side of the parking lot. &nbsp;BVD
was welcomed to the busy establishment of Applebees and escorted to the bar by
hostess Just Diana, plastic vessels in hand. &nbsp;Laughter ensued, cash was
tossed, Just Melissa our barmistress was enchanted by BVD. &nbsp;Other servers
took hash cards, the clientele were excited to participate in the BVD frivolity.
&nbsp;After two pitchers, Applebees gave BVD the third pitcher free.<br>
Lessons learned: &quot;Suck&quot; Alley.. bad. &nbsp;&nbsp;Applebees friggen
incredibly great!<br>
<br>
Trail? &nbsp;On-Out of Applebees found our hares to be gone with the wind.
&nbsp;On-On was sounded and BVD Hash no. 64 was underway. &nbsp;East we went
through the parking lot, then north making an extended circle and into the Palm
Bay shiggy. &nbsp;On-On through swamp, On-On through canals, the esteemed GM
Fireindahole having recovered from surgery was On-On through it all like the
fine champion she is. &nbsp;On-On through town homes and access paths.<br>
<br>
As the shiggy thickens the hounds are packed together without the ability for a
clear FRB or DFL to emerge. &nbsp;Count backs and YBF’s are cleverly placed
and accurate as to accomplish keeping the front runners in a dead heat with the
rear of the pack. &nbsp;The consistent Alpha Female being Circle Blow who nips
at the heels of the leaders throughout the hash. &nbsp;One might think she has
been practicing on non-hash weekends as her energy level this day has
quadrupled.<br>
<br>
Yips and howls ring out as the pack enters the area of Serenoa repens the
dreaded Saw Palmetto. &nbsp;The fawn-like Lollipop leaping palms as a thicker
and slower Kojak is sliced and diced. &nbsp;The Ho, Yanksit, Suckulater, Bike
Bitch, Poker, S-Wax, Fireindahole, Ass Packet and Circle Blow are all bleeding
on this our heaviest slash hash to date. &nbsp;On-On we go until emerging at a
retention ditch and the Beer Near half-way. &nbsp;Our lacerations and bruises
appear as proud battle wounds and through the foam we all congratulate each
other on surviving what has become one of BVD’s most memorable hashes ever.
&nbsp;Briefly the pack considers halting the trail and seeking medical
assistance, however getting wind of the plan, Just Puke tosses out that extra
credits and yes… the evil Apple Pies are hidden in the second half. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Five minutes of rest and clotting before the pack is again On-Into the deepest
shiggy to date. &nbsp;Water crossings, swamp crossings and the trail takes a
surprising turn. On-Up onto a 6 foot wall the pack must climb and perform a
gymnast balance beam walk for 200 yards. &nbsp;&nbsp;Picture in your mind that
you are in an affluent home in an affluent neighborhood when out your back doors
you see 15+ adults in age from 23 to 60 in shorts and tanks with whistles all
bleeding from the waist down walking your back wall an inch at a time. &nbsp;Bringing
up the rear of this Special Olympics act is Suckulater, Ass Packet and Slow
Poker when a kindly property owner comes out to inform us, not to get off her
wall, but says &quot;Excuse me, I believe you’ve had a scratch&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;NO SHIT, I’VE LOST 4 PINTS OF BLOOD, I AM ABOUT TO PASS OUT, FALL OFF
THIS WALL AND DIE IN YOUR YARD--- BIOOOTCH&quot;. &nbsp;But no, the Suckulater
said &quot;Oh, thank you ma’am, we’re just passing by.&quot;<br>
<br>
A block ahead in deep shiggy we came upon that miracle that has changed our
lives. &nbsp;There hidden on trail was all the chilled ingredients for Apple Pie
Shots. &nbsp;We stopped and partook and partook and partook until we didn’t
care to ever leave the forest. &nbsp;Time and darkness finally forced us onward.<br>
<br>
On-On we went and found the On-In, some dragging, some limping, most whining,
but all having a sense of accomplishment. &nbsp;The circle gathered and
down-downs were downed, accusations were celebrated until the mosquitoes smelled
the fresh blood and launched their attack.<br>
<br>
Hash No. 64 was tough, bloody and our roughest trail ever however, it may well
have been one of the best marked, best division of count backs,

extra credit placement to date. &nbsp;We thank the hares for their diligence and
planning. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Our circle complete and business done, we offered a word of prayer for our IFH,
Socks and the healing and rehabilitation of her father. &nbsp;They have been
missed from our group and we hope to see them again soon.<br>
<br>
Until the next time,<br>
May the Hash Go in Peace.<br>
