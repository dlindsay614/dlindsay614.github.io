<p>Well, before i begin, let me apologize for any error i might made in the hash trash.
After all, almost three weeks have past since are last romp in the palmettos! In my
previous hash trash, i falsely accused two hashers for having sex on trail. Yes, it&#146;s
true. In fact, it were Pocket Shuttle and UPS that screwed on trail! Now, for the detail
of hash #20. Maggot and Red Hot Anus Popper laid a fabulous trail, primarily off-road. We
thoroughly enjoyed the water crossings (five of them) and even walked through a
slippery-when-wet tunnel. Climbing out of the tunnel, and up a hill, proved to be quite a
challenge. Some of us managed to slide down a couple of times before making it up. Our
hares treated us with two refreshing water stops along the way. Now, imagine me sitting at
my computer, trying to remember where we ended up for the down-down circle. i&#146;ll be
damned if i can&#146;t remember. No matter. i do remember who blesses us with their
presence in the circle, though. We had two virgins, Just Mach (Mark with a Bostonian
accent), and Just Tom. Next it was the hares on ice, followed by the FRBs, Mentral Pad and
Cum Dumb. Yanker took advantage of our newby, Just Mach, and put him promptly on the ice
for that lovely accent of him. Our only visitor, Thorn, from Daytona, was honored with a
down-down. The following people did down-downs for &quot;too long between hashes&quot;:
Cooter Kitten, Scrubbed, Crum Chomper, Bitch Come Here, Cockpity, Butt Jeep, and Poop
Burgler. Somehow, Thorn got smooshed between two harriettes on the ice and rather than
drink their beers, they gave him a beer bath. Our GM, Kotex, announced that all hashers
must worn shirts in the circle. After two of our harriettes removed their shirts (tits out
for the boys), Kotex clarified that everyone needs to wear a &quot;HASH&quot; shirt.
Kotex&#146;s Secret Service boys, Ass Wrangler and Turd Booger, sat on ice next. This was
followed by accusations. Bloody Pad was accused of taking off her shoes for the first
water crossing. Two sinners were among us and had to do down-downs. Your very own On-Sec</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">,<b> </b></font><i><font FACE="Arial" size="3">Fireindahole</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">, </font></i><font FACE="Arial">had to do a down-down for
inaccuracies in the last hash trash&#151;can you imagine that?! The next sinner was
Yankhim who failed to hash with the New Orleans HHH while visiting the area. The 50% rule
applied and you know what that means. The last four down-downs were Loaner Boner, Robert
Frost, Thorn, and Come Cum. We polished off the keg soon after the circle closed. The
on-after took place at some Mexican Restaurant off of Babcock&#151;amazing how i can
remember all that other stuff and not the name of the restaurant! Oh well, we had one
helluva great time! </font>
