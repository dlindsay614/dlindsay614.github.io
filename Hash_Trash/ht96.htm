<br>
</b></font>Awesome turnout! Timmy and Virgin, Just Jenn, Kojak &amp; Lollipop, ATC, 
Just Brad, Slow Poker,<br>
Timmy, Eat A Pus and Harry Cheeseballs. Shop and Ass Whisperer showed up late 
(better late than never).<br>
Oh yeah, I was there too.<br>
<br>
No planning went into the trail so I expected it to be really messed up. Started 
the hash at Circles of&nbsp; Care.<br>
No circle at the circle though. I marked the first 10 or so plops to give me a 
head start 10 minutes before starting.<br>
By the way, it was way cold. Kojak picked up my new shoes out of the back of the 
blue beast and<br>
suggested I run in them. Yeah right. Harry was overheard saying that he forgot 
his pants. Timmy took my ear <br>
warmers and was after any other clothes I would give up if I was a true 
gentleman. F-that I say. It was cold.<br>
<br>
Kojak wanted to be home by 9:00 to get some bush...(I mean watch Bush). Amazing, 
this crotchety old a$$<br>
still thinks about getting bush. He is my hero. <br>
<br>
Quick chalk talk and off I went. Asked for 10 minutes but I wasted 2 minutes 
before I even left. First check and<br>
a quick count back 7 to buy a little time. Off we go with orange tinted flour. A 
check here, a check there,<br>
a YBF or two and a few plops in between as I went. Got us around Pro Health 
where a woman stopped to check my <br>
plop, after I answered her question about what I was doing. I saw her check it 
like they do on tv to see if I was<br>
throwing cocaine out as I ran. Maybe she thought it was Anthrax and thought 
rubbing her hand in it would be a good idea.<br>
Went past a lot of the old hash haunts in the area and tried to outfox Harry. 
Across US1, down River Road and a YBF<br>
behind that building that we always run around when we are in the area. Up to On 
Tap and across 192 through the <br>
parking garage. False trail up the garage (like trail would be that short). 
Crossed US1 again and into downtown Melbourne.<br>
Through and alley, up to 192, down 192 and back into downtown Melbourne. Started 
hearing the whistles and had to do<br>
some weaving to try and gain some distance. Back across 192 through Alliance 
title and off to 'Da Hood.<br>
No to be confused with 'Da Tube. Decided to stop throwing flour and write a note 
on the&nbsp; sidewalk instructing everyone <br>
to go down to the next block and take a left on Lincoln. Trail start again. Ran 
and plopped laying true trails across the road and <br>
back again just to be an a$$. Trying to get back to an ending area when my bag 
of flour suffered from spontaneous combustion.<br>
OK, it didn't catch on fire, but, it did explode and left the largest plop on 
trail I've ever seen. Went a little further and came<br>
across some graffiti spray painted on the sidewalk. &quot;All you need is love.&quot; I 
was touched so I lined it in chalk.<br>
Yeah, I can be soft, vulnerable and an a$$hole all within a few minutes. Miller 
High Life brings <br>
out the best in me. At the starting point looking for someplace dark and I spot 
it.<br>
I head that way (head, who said head....?) and low and behold, I see my final 
destination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Almost there when Eat A Pus jumps out of the dark and scares the piss out 
of me. He got <br>
lost and ranged his way back to the start. Isn't it Slow Poker who has that 
reputation? :)<br>
He admits to not snagging me, just getting lost and lucky. We move the cars and 
Eat A Pus busts<br>
out some great blues as everyone start to come in. Just Brad is FRB and the beer 
drinking commences.<br>
ATC is next and like always, he trying to help everyone behind him find the end 
as we're hiding behind the bushes <br>
freezing our nuts off. Timmy pees in the bushes. Kojak come in and starts 
bitching. Like we didn't see that coming.<br>
Its just part of why we like your old a$$ so much. Don't change, love ya, mean 
it. Everyone in except<br>
Shop and Ass Whisperer. ATC leaves to go look for them (imagine that) and we 
finally start circle. We figured <br>
they were fornicating or at least uprooting trees and bushes. The block of ice 
was warmer than my cold wet shorts,<br>
so dropping pants and sitting on ice was a joy that night. I was there quite a 
while. I even had to experience Da'Tube.<br>
I gotta get one of those. Thanks for bringing it to Brevard County Kojak. Shop 
teacher and Ass Whisper finally show up.<br>
They were serenaded with We Are the Boys of Old Florida in honor of Ohio State's 
play in Monday night's Siesta bowl.<br>
We convince them that we had only been there a few minutes. Just Brad tries to 
name himself. What a wanker. He <br>
confesses to not having his security clearance since he confessed to smoking pot 
8 years ago. Even our former president<br>
the rock star didn't confess to inhaling. There it is, I think it might have 
been Shop Teacher (naming another hasher....)<br>
who came up with Mary Jane, I just can't remember. He's now Mary Jane. He even 
confesses to wearing new shoes.<br>
Next, he drinking out of his shoes with a little help from Da Tube. Timmy's 
virging clearly states that it would be <br>
easier to use Da'Tube and drink out of a shoe. Poor Bastard now has to strip off 
his shirts and find out first hand how<br>
&quot;easy it was.&quot; He even used Mary Jane's shoe so we could have a proper 
scientific experiment.<br>
<br>
Mary Jane got promoted and was ready to celebrate. On After moved from Hooter's 
to On Tap since Mary Jane was<br>
&nbsp;buying the first round. We can't give a rat's a$$ where we are as long as 
the beer is cheap or bein bought by someone else.<br>
&nbsp;$4.00 cover at the door since there is a DJ. Harry CheapBalls and Keep A 
Buck want to leave since they don't want to pay.<br>
Hash Cash pays their cover and the music is pretty good. Harry turns out to 
being a closet MC Hammer fan. Ok, he said the<br>
music was good but MC Hammer was on the decks. That qualifies him as a closet MC 
Hammer fan.<br>
Beer and wings are on the table when I decide to order more wings. Timmy bitches 
about not wanting &quot;HOT&quot; wings.<br>
Why do you think they're called &quot;hot wings&quot; you dumba$$? Everyone leaves except 
Harry, Eat a Pus and myself.<br>
&nbsp;Then the next big plate of wings come. Notice I was there with the two 
cheap skates who didn't want to pay the cover? <br>
Well, they must have decided to at least get &quot;their&quot; money's worth from the DJ. 
Ate a lot of those wings and took the rest home.<br>
<br>
A hot shower, a hot electric blanket and my a$$ cheeks were just starting to 
thaw out when the wings ignited like they were<br>
&nbsp;in the pits of hell and decided they wanted out. My a$$ was now fully 
thawed and Snip It finally went to bed at about 5:30 am.<br>
Rugrats were up by 6:15 and my brain is starting to fail from lack of sleep. In 
fact I just ate the rest of the wings<br>
&nbsp;to see how bad I could really mess up my sleep patterns.<br>
<br>
Anyways, it always a pleasure to spend time with my fellow hashers. I already 
have so many great memories and stories and I haven't<br>
been doing it for all that long. If you're still new to the hash environment, it 
only gets better. I haven't ever had a bad time on <br>
a hash and can't imagine that I ever will. I understand that Kojak is praying 
for senility to set in so he won't think he is going to hell.<br>
&nbsp;WARNING: HASH MEMORIES WILL CAUSE YOUR HAIR TO FALL OUT. <br>
Just check with Kojak and Harry. They're walking testimonials to the hash. 
Thanks for coming out. I hope I offended a few of you at <br>
some point in this review. See you in a few weeks for ATC's virgin trail. #100 
is right around the corner and I believe that Kojak and <br>
Lollipop have it under control. Thanks for allowing me to occupy your time.<br>
<br>
Snip It<br>
