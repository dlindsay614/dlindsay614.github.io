<p>Here&#146;s to our hares, they&#146;re true blue. They are hashers through and through.
They are piss pots so they say. Tried to go to heaven but they went the other
way&#133;.thank Gispert for Hoosier, Moaner and Mullet who stepped up to hare BVD H3 #19
at the last minute. You can blame your hare raiser (me!) for that and then do me&#133;..a
favor and volunteer to be the hare raiser cum January when we elect a new mismanagement.
So, we started out #19 in the sweltering sun in a vacant bank parking lot. Our hares
pulled a &quot;gotcha&quot; when they took off to lay the trail live. That lasted for
about 50 feet and then they were on-back, yelling &quot;On-Out!&quot; It was the
hounds&#146; turn to find this dead urbanized trail. We found the true trail through
several alleys for about a mile when we came upon a fine drinking establishment&#133;the
Backroad Bar. The place was packed with a crowd of &quot;biker dudes.&quot; We, of course,
fit right in. Five dollar pitchers and we were as happy as a harriette&#146;s hand in a
harrier&#146;s pocket. We stayed as long as the hares would allow us, but they eventually
shooed us back out on trail. The pack had split in two or three small packs by this point.
I joined the rather slow moving, beer-belly pack. The only competition here was to keep
from being the FRB. After walking a half mile or so, we spotted some hashers on the top
floor of Dr. Joe&#146;s Intercoastal Bar. They tried to hide from us, but it was too late.
We became the SCBs (short-cutting bastards) and headed up to join the others. Evidently,
we cut out one or two other beer stops, but we were content with Dr. Joe&#146;s. Before
long, we were joined with the entire pack. As is the BVD H3 tradition, a block of ice was
positioned for the down-down circle. We began with Kojak on ice because he missed a hash
and couldn&#146;t remember this was BVD&#146;s 19<sup>th </sup>hash. Then Red Hot Anal
Pepper took to the ice for producing our new BVD Hash Shirts!!!! (For only $10.00, you can
purchase a t-shirt or tank top&#151;they&#146;re going fast, so bring extra money if you
want a BVD H3 hash shirt!) Hares were honored with down-downs, followed by a virgin to
BVD, just Blake. The HUYA was passed on from I&#146;d Fuck Her to Sky Box because she
occasionally wears flip flops on trail and always leaves the hash early. Next was a
down-down for our FRB, Cum Chum. Kojak and Itchy Cajones drank--too long between hashes,
Mullet&#146;s Sperm (Mullet&#146;s dad&#146;s hash name) sat on ice with Mullet belting
out a hash tune in honor of his father, visitors from Orlando were up next, and finally
the 50% rule. The group applied some peer pressure and Chaz the bartender did a down-down.
We finished with the beer prayer just as Rod Pumper and Just Theresa found us. They sat on
ice for sex on trail. A rendition of Swing Low and the circle was closed. By night fall,
the pack was on-out. A small group of us did an on-on-on at Matt&#146;s Tropical Grill and
Cigar Bar. This fine establishment is owned and operated by Kojak&#146;s son. We were
treated like the hashing Gods we are with fine food, beer, and live music. Stop by
sometime and tell him Kojak sent ya (next to Dos Amigos in Indianlantic). Hope to see
everyone at #20!</font>
