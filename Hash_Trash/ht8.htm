<p>Our 8<sup>th</sup> BVD hash turned out to be a fabulous day for the gathering of our
lads and beautiful lassies. The on-before took place at Meg O&#146; Malleys new Irish Pub
in historic downtown Melbourne. Thirty or so hashers, decked out in green, took over half
of the bar for the on-before hash celebration. Our live hares, Yanksit and Red Hot Anal
Pepper, took off to lay the trail&#151;not an easy thing to do considering Red Hot&#146;s
incapacitated state (of mind). After a quick chalk talk, starring a local elderly drunken
woman, the pack was on-out. Immediately, the pack split apart into two groups&#151;the
FRBs (front running bastards) and the SWBs (slow walking bastards). We made our way
through the streets, weaving in and out, back and forth, deeper, deeper&#151;no wait,
that&#146;s not till later. The trail led us out of town, through a park and up to US 1.
Déjà vu of Yanksit&#146;s long-ass Hash #3 on US 1 lingered in our minds. But all was
okay. We turned left into a park and down to the river. The trail headed back up to US 1,
heading back toward downtown Melbourne. What&#146;s this?! BN (beer near) so soon? It
can&#146;t be &#150;not Yanksit who&#146;s earned himself a name (Bastard) for long
trails. Heaven was in sight. The hash ended at the Indian River Brewery. We were
pleasantly surprised by the short trail (1.5 miles) and to find a cold, tapped keg
awaiting us. Our circle of down-downs was held amongst the monstrous beer fermentation
tanks. Yanksit sat on ice while our GM, Kojak, introduced our virgins in the circle. More
down-downs for the HUYA (given to Red Hot for his fucked up leg), Deep Stick because she
DIDN&#146;T survive Daytona, and visiting GM from Oralando. We also had 5 namings: Just
Rob was named Rod Pumper; Just Nate was named Boulder Holder; Just Brian was named Turd
Burglar; Just Karen was named Air Bush; and Just Jeff was named Ass Tickler. With the
circle closed, we polished off the keg. Hashers slowly trickled back to Meg O&#146;
Malleys for an on-after. Our already drunken group enjoyed more beer and loud songs, but
was asked to quiet down. Kicked out &amp; so soon?! Good job hashers! So, we were on-on to
Hoosierdaddy and Mullet&#146;s house and we car pooled to the on-on-on house party with
wankers anxiously awaiting our arrival. About a dozen of our drunken lads and lassies
mingled among the well-dressed hasher wanna-bees. After a couple hours of food and drink,
we headed back to Mullet &amp; Hoosier&#146;s house and &quot;got down&quot; to the sounds
of the Grease Soundtrack. The lassies sang and our lads looked on and eventually had some
&quot;tits out for the boys.&quot; BVD hash #9, here we cum! </font>
