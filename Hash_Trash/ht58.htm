2002.</b> <br>
<br>
&#145;Twas an eerie foreboding as the pack gathered for this BVD&#146;s 58th hash.
&nbsp;Such large and ever looming questions; &nbsp;Is this year different, would the
inevitable finally come to pass? &nbsp;Would a life be lost on trail? &nbsp;Would <b>Kojak
</b>come out of the hole, see his shadow and in doing so provoke 50 more years of hashing?
&nbsp;What surprises lay ahead on the celebration trail? <br>
<br>
The pack gathered with the usual punctuality at 2pm.. and 2:30.. and 2:45 and 3pm.. north
of the Sports Authority in Melbourne, FL. &nbsp;Our hares of the day <b>Slow Poker and
S-Wax </b>were ready and waiting with Jello shots and lager to prepare the pack for their
trail. <br>
<br>
Hash cash and Haberdashery business done, we welcomed our visitor <b>Comes-With-Stick</b>
and an energetic <b>Just Jessica</b> (the virgin) to the hash. &nbsp;The chalk talk
accomplished, the hares were quickly away. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our <b>Songmeister I.F.H.</b> led
us in Father Abraham and 15 minutes later whistles blew and the pack was ON-ON. <br>
<br>
The hounds crossed the road east into Melbourne Square Mall through access roads and
traffic until the trail entered the main mall itself. &nbsp;It seems <b>Delta Dildo</b>
had some hashlife-long dream of hashing a mall and we are happy to have another hashdream
realized. <br>
<br>
On-On through the mall the pack went leaving stragglers hither and yon. &nbsp;Some several
losing all scent of the trail. &nbsp;In particular the <b>Bloody Ho</b> stopping in
Dillards to make water and leave her own scent trail.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
On-Out of the mall and On-Into a crime scene as the trail having been pre-laid was now
occupied by the local Constables and Fire Rescue. &nbsp;The chalk talk did not reveal the <b>DGOT</b>
symbol so no one expected to discover Dead Guy on Trail. &nbsp;The hash was promptly
diverted around the crime scene and the idea of adding the carcass to the HUYA was not
acceptable. <br>
<br>
At the half way point and Beer Near the pack was in disarray. &nbsp;Several hounds were
lost and required an autohasher to collect them and set them On-On to the proper trail
direction. &nbsp;From the half way an Eagle and a Turkey trail headed in separate
directions. &nbsp;Speaking from the Turkey point of view, we the pitiful, entered the
woods and discovered a homeless camp of crack heads and alcoholics (who, I might add did
have more libation, lager and vodka than our hash all put together). <br>
<br>
On-On to the end and the circle as <b>Just Robin</b> &amp; <strong>Just Amy</strong> slid
across the final water crossing dividing line for Melbourne Village and Melbourne Township
as DFL. &nbsp;A speedy <b>Without Socks</b> had finished FRB again. <br>
<br>
The <b>RA - Yanksit</b> assumed his position and we all circled up. &nbsp;Songs sang,
down-downs downed and the party was kicking into high gear when once again the local
constables interrupted the festivities. &nbsp;A neighbor had heard the racket and called
in a complaint. &nbsp;No 58 &quot;The Homicide Hash&quot; had more police than a night on
the town with <b>Just Puke and Gilligan</b>, &nbsp;if you can imagine. &nbsp;With our
promise to clean the area after our circle (<i>Did you hear that Mr. Knight of the Brevard
County Park and Recs, EPA?</i>) and to lower our voices, the constable allowed us to
continue. <br>
<br>
The HUYA was passed from Kojak to Without Socks (again) for his &quot;it&#146;s
heavy&quot; whining previously. &nbsp;A spontaneous naming occurred as the pack had
knowledge that <b>Just Greg</b> was headed On-Out from BVD on temporary assignment.
&nbsp;The <b>GM-Fireindahole</b> &nbsp;could not let our hound end up being named by some
other pack and just Greg became baptized into the BVD Hash as <b>&quot;Cock Gobbler&quot;.
&nbsp; </b><br>
<br>
With a final explosion of the beer cooler, the hash sang Swing Low and parted ways to the
On-After at the Pour House Lounge. &nbsp;This hash was most certainly exciting,
entertaining and a good time was had by all (except one, but he wasn&#146;t complaining
face down in the ditch). &nbsp;A special thanks to the Hares for all their work and extra
credits hidden along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
A quick reminder for those of you that have not registered for Bike Week, the cost is now
$50 each. &nbsp;Do it soon if you&#146;re planning on going so that they have a proper
count and enough beer etc. <br>
