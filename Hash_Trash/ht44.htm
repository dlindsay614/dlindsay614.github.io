<br>
HARE:&nbsp; Just Puke.<br>
<br>
It was a wet, nasty, FL rainy season day and when yours truly and my all day sucker
arrived at close to Hash Standard Time the three of us wondered if there would be a hash
at all.&nbsp; The rain was really cummin down.&nbsp; Suddenly (s)Tumbalina appeared and
without so much as a hello opened her trunk and produced the most amazing array of
restraints one has ever seen outside of an expensive bondage sex video.&nbsp; You see,
dear reader, our illustrious HARE seems to have gotten himself arrested by Cocoa Beach's
finest two weeks previously at the Red Dress Run and spent the evening in the lock-up.
&nbsp; So, some of the pack had decided this was going to be a jail house rock theme run.
&nbsp; Anyhow, our jail bird was immediately put into a black leather doggy collar and
leather cuffs at wrist and ankles, the whole lot joined together with an interesting bunch
of chrome plated chain and then the whole thing locked together with little padlocks.
&nbsp; Your humble scribe, assuming that (s)Tumbalina didn't go out and purchase this
stuff early Saturday morning, asked what she normally did with this stuff.&nbsp; Humble
scribe was essentially told to F**k Off.&nbsp; Anyhow, jail bird suitably restrained, we
were still wondering if anyone was going to join this foursome when suddenly a few cars
arrived and then more and until we had 18 real Hashers (crazy idiots) standing around in
the downpour laughing it up.&nbsp; Reason being we had a whole group of suitably dressed
court room people.&nbsp; Let's see, there was biker cop IFH, the press Dr. WSocks, and
lawyers for both sides, etc.&nbsp; And then it was time to get underway (underwater).
&nbsp; Puke stood around with a shit eatin grin while the pack struggled to find the
beginning.&nbsp; It was damned well concealed.&nbsp; Finally someone hollered ON ON and we
were off.&nbsp; Yeah, that's right, seems like we were OFF trail right from the start.
&nbsp; We soon crossed a creek which we apparently were not supposed to, (a lot of the
toilet paper and flour had kind of shriveled up and nearly disappeared in the downpour.)
and meandered around the woods until we came out on a street.&nbsp; The FRBs were way
ahead and then they suddenly came back.&nbsp; So we ran back the other way and it seemed
weird that there were plops of flour on all the lamp posts in the direction we were now
going.&nbsp; Soon BEER NEAR appeared and there was much rejoicing.&nbsp; Short lived.
&nbsp; We had found the end of the trail and there was no beer cause Puke was at the
halfway and we were totally messed up and very wet.&nbsp; So we went looking and after a
few minutes of people going every which way we finally heard ON ON by Gym Nasty (I think)
and sure enough it led, via a very very wet trail to the halfway.&nbsp; So we had a few
cool ones (hot coffee or cocoa would probably have been more welcome) put Salad Shooter in
cuffs for a bit for some discretion and then Puke was telling some of our shorter Hashers
that perhaps they should ride with him as there was another creek to cross only this one
was a good five feet deep two days earlier.&nbsp; Yeah right, after hearing this a quick
decision was made to short cut back the way we had cum.&nbsp; What the hell, we knew where
the end was.&nbsp; We were all wet and cold (except for one) and anxious to get this
silliness over.<br>
<br>
We got to the end and about the same time as Puke and were soon circled up by the GM and
the fun began.&nbsp; Of course Puke was the first on ice and stayed for quite some time
and several down downs for all sorts of accusations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lollipop and Butt
Wrangler got down downs for being away too too long.<br>
And we had a naming. Just Eileen was named Dick Sniffer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Now, I mentioned above that someone stayed kinda dry.&nbsp; You see, Slow Poker did
the entire Hash carrying a great big golf umbrella, (when the hell did that become part of
Hashing paraphernalia?).&nbsp; Your RA and yours truly had a little private plan to fix
that, so when everyone who had not had a down down got called into the circle and they
were drinking Slow Poker suddenly got a couple bottles of water poured on him.&nbsp; (Hey,
Slow, at least I used warm water).&nbsp; By this time most of the hardy group was
shivering like crazy so we did a quick beer prayer and were out of there.<br>
<br>
Don't know how many went to the ON AFTER as Lolli and I had another engagement but, we did
have time to get home and jump in the hot tub for a bit, mmmmmmmmmm, that was nice.<br>
<br>
ON OUT<br>
