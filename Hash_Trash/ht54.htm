Hares: Suck-U-Later&nbsp; &amp; Bloody Ho<br>
Location: Grill's Tiki Bar - Port Canaveral<br>
Date: 08 Dec 01<br>
<br>
For the second time in a very short time span our illustrious group of<br>
Hashers had to brave the Central Florida highways and find their way to<br>
the northeastern extremes of the county.&nbsp; What's next, Titusville?<br>
<br>
The usual group of 25 - 30 runners(?) met at Grills Seafood and Tiki Bar<br>
located right in the port.&nbsp; A nice spot where our Hawaiian shirts stood<br>
out prominently among the usual cracker crowd and touristas.&nbsp; Hey, we<br>
were celebrating &quot;remember Pearl Harbor&quot;.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The Hares dragged everyone out thru the huge parking lot to do chalk<br>
talk and then sent everyone back to the bar for the start.&nbsp;&nbsp; There<br>
surely was a good reason for that but since I wasn't feeling up to par<br>
it escaped me.&nbsp; Then the pack went off down toward the main drag where<br>
it appeared nobody could quite figure out where the hell to go.&nbsp; They<br>
went right, some went left.&nbsp; The ones who went left came back and so did<br>
the ones who went right.&nbsp; When they thought they had it all sorted out<br>
they went bum f**k all wrong.&nbsp; This might be a good little lesson for<br>
you shortcutters cause I think you are what caused virtually everyone to<br>
run a good deal of the run ass backwards (we used to have a Hasher by<br>
that name).&nbsp; Most Hashers and Harriettes got to the end before they had<br>
hardly begun.&nbsp; As I was driving the beer truck, accompanied by Sniffa,<br>
we laughed our butts off cause though they found the end they still had<br>
5 miles or so to go before they were going to see any ON IN beer.&nbsp; Well<br>
that didn't bother folk too much because there was a beer stop less than<br>
halfway where our Hares spent a small fortune in providing free beer<br>
(nice gesture guys).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
So Sniffa and I thought this was so much fun we would go to the halfway<br>
in the park near the beach to see what was going to happen next.&nbsp; A real<br>
nice spot.&nbsp; A few runners started showing up and then Sniffa felt sorry<br>
for Sex Wax and went to fetch her by auto.&nbsp; Oh yeah, there was a hell of<br>
a lot of auto hashing before the day was over.&nbsp; In the interim Bloody Ho<br>
was setting out some nice Jell-O shots (recipe:&nbsp; coconut flavored rum<br>
and pineapple Jell-O) with cute little umbrellas in them.&nbsp; S/Wax got<br>
into those and just about sucked up the entire lot, well no, that's not<br>
quite true, as I did get one, mmmmm good.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
And now our illustrious GM and his RUNNING partner Tooth Fairy show up<br>
and they have cum from the beach.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; S-U-L looked a bit bewildered<br>
and then realized they had run the whole damned thing backwards to that<br>
point.&nbsp; It was worth it though as they were the only ones (I think) to<br>
see the photo shoot of the latest in bikini fashions out on the beach.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
So, I decided I had better get the beer to the end as there was no<br>
telling where in hell anybody was at that point.&nbsp; No sooner got the keg<br>
tapped and mugs started appearing.&nbsp; And everyone did manage to find the<br>
ON IN - again.<br>
<br>
CIRCLE THE:&nbsp; no that's not a typo.&nbsp; Since everything had gone tits up to<br>
this point our GM/RA decided to do the circle backwards too.&nbsp; We toasted<br>
&quot;may the Hash go in peace&quot;.&nbsp; Then we Swung Low.&nbsp; Down downs were done<br>
before the &quot;drink it down down&quot;.&nbsp; Butts got chilled.&nbsp; Fuckleberry was<br>
honored with the Hash Shit from Bike Bitch as he was the only one<br>
present not wearing the appropriate uniform.<br>
<br>
And then we had what has to be one of the fastest naming in BVD history.<br>
Our poet laureate's nephew, whose wanker name escapes me, was quickly<br>
baptized CUMIKAZE.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; spelling differs from the one on the web<br>
site, but I checked my dictionary (here we go again!!).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We were then welcomed to BVD Run #54 and we were ON OUT to the ON AFTER<br>
which was back at the Tiki Bar.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Despite the fact that the trail was run a bit differently everyone had a<br>
blast.&nbsp; Good job Hares.<br>
<br>
Hope everyone got home safely, these long drives are a bitch.<br>
<br>
Until next time, yes, I think I get one more next time.<br>
