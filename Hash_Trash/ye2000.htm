<p><font face="Arial">The first run. We had recently decided to start a Hash and were at a
Christmas party at Hoosier and Mullet's sitting around talking about it and somebody
(Yanksit?) decided we should have a run. We were all pretty pissed at this point, must
have been about 10:00 PM. Somebody laid trail and we ran around a couple of blocks. Then
we did a terrific circle around Mullet's pool, got very loud, sang hash songs and totally
freaked out the neighbors. Mullet and Hoosier have been contemplating moving ever since. I
also have to mention Run #2 in Cocoa where I was presented with the first HUYA and then it
was stolen. Boy, was I embarrassed. But it was one of the best/fun hashes we have had. Has
to be the first time we ended at Indian River Brewery. Nobody lets Hashers into a brewery,
nobody. And then we went back, but I missed that one.<br>

My most memorable moment had to be when I had a great error in judgement and volunteered
to hare a run, and have it end at my house. Skybox and I planned out a trail that actually
is one of the most scenic that BVDH3 has seen (or not seen). Unfortunately I did not heed
the advice of whoever said &quot;Never underestimate the stupidity of large groups&quot;.
Thanks to an ill advised true trail error, whose intent was to just get folks across
Wickham road, this large group went over a half mile with no flour or other marks on the
wrong side of the ditch, and wound up hitting the end section of the trail. Some went
backwards, others just went to their car. About a dozen souls found the beer stop, and I
found most of the thirsty pack back at my house before me. We had a pretty decent party at
Casa Bitch, but as usual, my co-hare Skybox left early, leaving me to warm the ice for a
looong time. I was also lucky enough to have Otis show from O town, and somehow did not
get in trouble with the neighbors, who never said a thing..</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Interesting things I found that might give a half mind pause before
doing what I did:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">a) Toilet paper in the bottom of the pool after Ho did the Rocky
Horror thing and was thrown in.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">b) Lipstick on the concrete lion (boy that's hard to get off)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">c) Photographs of genitals, breasts, and Otis' ass on my camera
along with the formal shots of my now ex-girlfriend.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">d) Seeing the most graphic photos in the hash album using my house
as a back drop</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">e) Lots of leftover beer, thanks to the pass of the hat and the beer
fairies (Thanks Fire and Pussy G)..</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I must say that many of the hashers pitched in to help clean up, and
Skybox returned the next day and we had the place lookin' spic and span all over again. By
the way, if you are loaded, Casa Bitch is for sale! Might I do it again? I still want the
hash to visit that area, but I think I will do something different for the end this
time...</font></p>

Besides watching Crotch Duster projectile vomit at Hoosier and Mullets on the night of the
virgin, I would say the day I met Pussy Gourmet on trail and telling her she was the girl
of my dreams...BVD created a Hash engagement!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Experience? Only one?! The most memorable for me has to be getting
&quot;asked to leave&quot; the Interoom Cabaret during the Toga Hash because they couldn't
handle a bare ass! <br>
<br>
I also loved the Mem-oral pool party at Kojak's house, the shiggy-filled trails of Cum
Chum, having the best beer of any hash in FL, all the controversy (keeps us interesting!)
and of course all the debauchery BVD is known for!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have a few memorable hashes. Haring the first hash of the BVD H3
from Hoosierdaddy and Mullets house with Crotchduster and watching him projectile vomit
and then do a down-down, you&#146;ve got to appreciate a hasher with that talent. The
millionaire hash was awesome. Cum Chum is an excellent hare. Red Hot lifting my toga in
the titty bar and getting thrown out &#150; now that&#146;s a first! Ending in a brewery
&#150; my dream cum true! Being a part of naming someone &#145;I&#146;d Fuck Her&#146; and
have her continue hashing. Finally, the record number of theme hashes and having the great
job of R.A. at one of the coolest hashes. An awesome year!</font></p>

Hash #29&#133;Wow! Well, I was named at Turd Burglar &amp; Butt Wrangler&#146;s Hash (Toga
Hash at Cocoa Beach)&#133;so that&#146;s a memory for me&#133;rain it was, but we were
there! I&#146;ve accepted my name, so no more I.F.H&#133;it&#146;s </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I&#146;d have to say that one of my favorite hashes was the toga
hash. The weather really sucked until we headed out on trail. The pub crawl was great and
of course, how many hash groups can say they&#146;ve been kicked out of a titty bar?! A
lady in a car stopped us on trail, curious about our attire, and ended up giving us a
couple of her hard lemonades she just bought&#133;a little refreshment for the road. I
also had a lot of fun on the &quot;Blair Witch&quot; trail. I don&#146;t remember who laid
it (probably Sir Flatulot or Cum Chum), but a bunch of us got stuck in a circle until
Tumbalina jetted out of the woods and found the true trail in a wink. What a great time we
had in 2000! I can&#146;t wait to experience the hashes in 2001!</font></p>
