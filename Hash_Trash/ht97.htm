</b></font>Well, well, well. Where to start. Snip &amp; Timmy car pooled and were 
the first to arrive. On the way it was a quick stop by Slow Poker's <br>
house to see S'wax and Ryan. Gotta get the ice since Poker had a skateboarding 
accident last week and was really sick. The dreaded <br>
double whammy. It really didn't have anything to do with driving down to Bayside 
Lakes. He really was sick. :) Also found out that <br>
Kojak just got home from the hospital where he was presented with a &quot;special 
gold plated&quot; arterial splint for being the crustiest old <br>
fart at the hospital this month. He's in the running for the Crusty Old Fart of 
the Year so rumor has it, he may be practicing for the <br>
rest of the year. All joking aside, I know I can speak for all of us that have 
met the old codger over the years and we really do hope <br>
he is doing well. We'll miss you on trail. Oh $hit! Someone better learn the 
kangaroo song. It's a helluva thing to do... I'll try <br>
and find out more and let everyone know what's happening.<br>
<br>
The weather was abso-f-ing lovely. Slightly cool to cold and a nice soft 
drizzle. Anyways Timmy went off for a quick bite and I smelled <br>
something funny in the air. Yes, it was Spermaid. You can smell him a mile off. 
He swears it's the diesel, but, I'm not buying it. <br>
Maybe we should all chip in for one of those things where they flush out your 
colon. Thats a lot of poo poo built up over the last sixty <br>
some odd years.<br>
<br>
Back to the hash, yada, yada, yada.. an 8.2 second chalk talk and ATC is off. 
Uh-oh. Virgin Trail. No help. What have <br>
we gotten ourselves into. Off through the woods. The big a$$ 1,000,000 candle 
watt Q-beam flashlight was a blessing. I don't <br>
care how small your flashlight is Harry, bigger flashlights cause straighter and 
longer beams! You pull the trigger and the beam just <br>
shoots out. Unfortunately without a proper charge, it &quot;petered out&quot; about half 
way through. :( <br>
<br>
Same $hit, different game. OK.... sit up Snips... this isn't the therapist's 
couch. Great trail with a lot of checks. My kind of <br>
trail. Disclaimer: The following opinion is not the opinion of the group or 
hashers in general. The following expressed view is the <br>
view of the author and the author only. If you don't like it, you can stop 
reading now. Go ahead, stop. STOP! Ok, you're still <br>
reading. Here goes, you can never have too many numbers in a countback, too many 
checks, or too many YBFs on trail. Ice is your <br>
friend on a hot day and Da Tube rocks. Evil spelled backwards is Live. So live, 
and listen to the little guy on your shoulder <br>
dressed in red. All he wants us to do is have a little fun. We are all sinners 
anyways. Repent. Oh crap, back off the couch and back <br>
to the hash.<br>
<br>
We ended at the exact same spot as the Hangover Hash. I'm deducting a point for 
not finding a different ending point. Hell, we even <br>
started at the same spot. Of course, I'll give the point back for having spicy 
jabanero chips served up in circle. Minus a point for <br>
no vessels. Give a point for cookies. A good crowd and a good time was had by 
all. Well marked trail. Good friends. A toast to G and <br>
our regulars who couldn't make it. Good shiggy (except for that deep sand at the 
end hat jumped up and grabbed your ankles, that <br>
$hit was deep), not too much pavement, a nice stroll down the fairway followed 
by a tour of the grand canals. Slow Poker's up <br>
next, ATC is chomping at the bit to do another one already. Timmy recruited Just 
Denise to the Bunny hash tonight. At one point Timmy <br>
and I heard something about Just Denise &quot;using up all the batteries.&quot; We'll have 
to remember that little fact nugget. I just <br>
got back from biking and it was friggin' cold. They didn't call me from the 
bunny hash about the ice block, so I'm guessing they just <br>
forgot to call. Oh yeah, on the way home, my cell rings and it's Spermaid. 
Someone put blocks of ice behind the wheels of his truck <br>
and he thinks it was me. I love picking up the phone and hearing &quot;fu*ker&quot;. He 
cracks me up every time he's around. That's the best <br>
thing about hashing, you really get to meet some fun people. <br>
<br>
Night all. I'm toasting you guys with a Milwaukee's Best Light as I finish 
typing. Ya know, that's the worst thing about hashing. <br>
Having to dispose of the leftover hash beer. Nothing impresses the neighbors as 
much as seeing a recycling bin full of Milwaukee's Best <br>
and Natural Lite cans. &quot;No, Mr Neighbor, I really am riding in this long bike 
ride for charity. All of the money you donate really does <br>
go to charity. Since my company matches whatever I collect, we really are doing 
some good. NO! I did not take the money and bye <br>
cheap beer. How could you say that?&quot; <br>
<br>
See you in a few weeks, sooner if I see you on Saturday, <br>
<br>
