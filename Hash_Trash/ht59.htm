Hares: Just Puke &amp; Salad Shooter<br>
Location: Palm Bay Regional Park<br>

Weather: 69ºF (With a Cold Wind Chill Factor) Broken Cover<br>

</big><font face="arial,helvetica" size="4">Off into the wild, wild west the
hashers we did go. &nbsp;This south west hash took us to the outer limits of our
fine county and Palm Bay Regional Park. &nbsp;For those of you who might not
have heard of that park - no wonder why. &nbsp;One has to hit Malabar Road and
go west, west, west of never to find it. &nbsp;Rumor had it that the trail was
way too close to Mexico and Border Patrol. &nbsp;Coincidentally, Short Straw was
a no show.<br>
<br>
The pack gathered in cold windy conditions. &nbsp;Our hares for the day, Just
Puke and Salad Shooter were laying the first completely live trail in some time.
&nbsp;Just Sophie opted (?) to join the hounds and not hare this event. &nbsp;Our
visitors for the day were 7Cums11 from Long Beach H3. &nbsp;Virgins? &nbsp;We
had virgins just Mark and just Rob thanks to Slow Poker. &nbsp;Pocket Rocket
came back to the hash after a long (we missed him) absence. &nbsp;Just Ann
returned to run with her Anus Doctor, Doctor Anus.<br>
<br>
The chalk talk was delivered at a timely 2:35pm with Count Backs, YBF’s,
&nbsp;Beer Near and oh yeah, Dick Checks. &nbsp;The hares were then On-Out
trailing flour and tissue. &nbsp;Fifteen minutes later, our Songmeister led
Father Abraham and BVD Hash number 59 was underway. &nbsp;(Yes, I said tissue
Michael Knight of the Brevard County Environmental Protection Parks and Rec.
Dept.)<br>
<br>
Off into the shiggy we ran as this desolate place lead us to our first dick
check and a canal system. Dr. Anus, Edgar Allen Ho, Fuckleberry and Cock Gobbler
made the crossing where Edgar’s beautiful new shoes lost that &quot;new shoe
smell&quot;. &nbsp;In the brush, eyes wide open, hounds W/O Socks and Yanksit
had to leap Snake-On-Trail with nothing more than &quot;d,d,d-jew-see-dat
&quot;. &nbsp;Rumor was it was a &quot;big-mutha&quot;. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Canal’s to the left, Canal’s to the right, the pack crossed leaving not hide
nor hair (hare) dry. &nbsp;Back into the shiggy and eastward we ran as the Bike
Bitch’s new battle cry &quot;Oh shit&quot; came to mean &quot;more water to
cross&quot;.<br>
<br>
Miracles on trail. &nbsp;Some hounds crossed the canals and plunged chest deep
into water, weed and mud others like Fireindahole, I.F.H, just Jessica, Circle
Blow and Ass Packet were able to prance deer-like across the surface
walking-on-water. &nbsp;Could this be a trick of speed and agility or just the
wisdom of picking the best crossing spot? &nbsp;The Sloth-like Suckulater will
never know.<br>
<br>
On-ahead the howling revealed that the Hares had been cornered. &nbsp;Wet, muddy
and shivering it was true, the hares were caught. &nbsp;Tag and release in
effect, the hares were on-out again and we ended where we had begun in the park.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing FRB was Without Socks, DFL Ass Packet arrived whining
&quot;I hate running&quot;.<br>
<br>
The circle gathered and commenced in a pavilion in the park. &nbsp;In the
absence of our Beermeister Potty, Kojak and S-Wax were able to keep the suds
flowing and hash flash to capture the moments infamy. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Our circle was somewhat abbreviated as Just Puke and Salad Shooter had the
Barbecue on and hotter than Erector Pad on a Saturday night. &nbsp;Flame broiled
burgers, hot dogs and all the fixins were dished up for a great finale to hash
number 69-10. &nbsp;Thanks Puke and Shooter. Most excellent hash! &nbsp;<br>
<br>
May the Hash Go (To Daytona) in Peace. &nbsp;Suck-U-Later, BVD On Sec.<br>
<br>
<b>Announcements:</b><br>
<br>
BVD’s next hash March 2nd will be in Daytona Beach at the Mayan Inn (Bike
Week). &nbsp;This is a combined hash with hounds and hares from near and far.
&nbsp;At last count 180+ are registered. &nbsp;Be there. &nbsp;We love Daytona
and the DBH3.<br>
<br>
March 16th is St. Patty’s Day Hash Number 61. &nbsp;We have received our
invite to be in the parade, it is official. &nbsp;The time will be 12:30 in
downtown Melbourne not the usual 2pm standard hash time. &nbsp;Get your outfits
ready. &nbsp;Green Dress, Kilt, Shorts, Moons, Stars, &nbsp;Clovers, &nbsp;we don't
care as long as it is green. &nbsp;The plan is to walk in the parade throwing
beads and candy to the crowds. &nbsp;We will have a truck and keg in the parade.
&nbsp;Make your plans now to arrive early. &nbsp;We will have a small trail
after the parade. &nbsp;More to cum on that. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
A hash - Get Well - to Potty Flavor. &nbsp;Hurry back man, we miss you!<br>
