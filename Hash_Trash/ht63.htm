</font></font><font lang="0" face="Arial" family="SANSSERIF" size="3">The pack
gathered Saturday at Rollins College in Melbourne for yet another running of the
BVD Hash House Harriers. &nbsp;We were a smaller than normal pack of hounds this
week as half of the pack were away at various events, business or on holidays.<br>
<br>
The BVD Hash Cash gathered the green and checked everyone in. &nbsp;Kojak was
away so no haberdashery was sold this week. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;&quot;G&quot;
was good to us and sent BVD new virgins (just Rob, just Kathy and just Thorin)
for this the 63rd running. &nbsp;Our visitors Doofus White Boy and Watch ‘em
Wiggle also came from north and west Florida to complete the group.<br>
<br>
Our hares for the day Yanksit and Edgar Allen Ho prepared for the live trail
while sniffing and greeting our virgins. &nbsp;A quick chalk talk later the
hares were on out to the north of Rollins.<br>
<br>
Our GM Fireindahole on post surgery light duty showed up and sat quietly
monitoring the activities of the group. &nbsp;Doofus White Boy started a few
antics and made the introductions around perking up the pack. &nbsp;With our
songmeister I.F.H. away Suckulater and Watch-em-Wiggle led the pack in Father
Abraham.<br>
<br>
With 14 or so minutes having passed and an anxious pack, our ever growing car
hashing group mounted their cars, our walkers were on-out walking, the sprinters
were away sprinting. &nbsp;&nbsp;BVD hash no. 63 was On-Out to the trail.<br>
<br>
Our hounds were On-Out from Rollins, passed a Land Yacht Harbor and directly
On-Into the shiggy as this was a trail with few sights of civilization.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it be possible that the lead for the first few blocks was
Stumbelina and S-Wax by the old sneaky secret walking off and getting a jump on
the pack trick? &nbsp;Welcome back to the hash Stumbelina (Thank &quot;G&quot;
for daylight savings time and the return of our own always smiling, tanned busty
blonde). &nbsp;You gotta love this chick!<br>
<br>
Bike Bitch and Suckulater were briefly ahead of the pack until the first major
turn when the wind from the big dogs Sir Flatchulot, &nbsp;Salad Shooter, Doofus
and Dr. Anus blew passed. &nbsp;Ok, so eventually everyone blew passed, but hell
we were old and winded early. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
On past a paint ball range and a few Rednecks until luck strikes on trail and
having thought they were behind and alone, we approached Zam-Bone-Me squatting
on trail. &nbsp;Just Thorin attempting to cover her private parts, no we
didn’t look. &nbsp;(Anyone believe that? &nbsp;I tried to sound convincing.)
&nbsp;Hint: &nbsp;Poop on trail. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
On-On to heavier shiggy where hounds were running quickly in all directions.
&nbsp;Sir Flatch, Just Puke, Dr. Anus, Just Rob, Just Kathy, just Thorin, Salad
Shooter, Zam-Bone-Me, Doofus White Boy, Suckulater and Bike Bitch had all lost
trail and were frantically running back and forth and over and through and
around the woods sniffing for trail.<br>
<br>
From deep in the wood came some laughter, some cursing and a few memorable
lines, such as:<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you not to follow fucking Puke!&quot; -Sir Flatchulot.<br>
&quot;Are you sure there are not spiders in these woods, I don’t like spiders
you know, they told me their wouldn’t be spiders&quot;. &nbsp;-Bike Bitch
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Are we ranging now, what the hell, let’s just range&quot; - Just Puke<br>
&quot;This is funny, we will come back even if Katie isn’t here.&quot; -Just
Kathy<br>
&quot;No really, it looks like maybe they crawled under this palmetto
here&quot;-Zam-Bone-Me<br>
<br>
After a few minutes and 47 miles covered back and forth in a one-block area, the
pack got the scent and On-On they went to the Beer Near and the half way. &nbsp;A
surprise of old past hash skunk ass beer and cheesy-poofs awaited the hounds at
the half way. &nbsp;MMM-mmm-good &nbsp;(NOT).<br>
<br>
On-out and On-into the shiggy and a few water crossings until the pack came to
finding the On-in and the circle in an Industrial area off Digital Light
Boulevard. &nbsp;FRB for the day was Dr. Anus and girlfriend of Dr. Anus (whose
name I have forgotten). &nbsp;Doofus White Boy who had ranged off into the deep
shiggy alone, somehow appeared at the circle in third or fourth or fifth place.
&nbsp;His secret? &nbsp;&quot;I dont know, I am hash-tactical and it
works&quot;-- Doofus<br>
<br>
The wait begins. &nbsp;We tapped the keg and waited, and drank, and waited for
signs of life to emerge from the shiggy. &nbsp;By name Stumbelina and Slow Poker
were now considered lost on trail. &nbsp;A few more beers and the roar of a
Harley revealed Surf with Stumbelina on the back. &nbsp;The good hasher from the
past rescued Stumbelina and sent S-Wax to retrieve Poker (our DFL) by car from
the wood.<br>
<br>
When all hounds were retrieved, Yanksit called the circle together and
down-downs began. &nbsp;Dr. Anus and girlfriend for FRB, Slow Poker for DFL,
Hares Yanksit and the Ho for the trail, Surf for too long between hashes, our
virgins Just Kathy, Just Rob and Just Thorin shy and shaking dropped their
drawers and sat on ice like new pups! &nbsp;We had two folks celebrating their
25th hash with BVD - Potty Flavor and Stumbelina. &nbsp;The Huya passed from
Just Puke to Zam-Bone-Me. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
With business done, we had a moment of silence and prayer for our dear hashing
family I.F.H. and Without Socks. &nbsp;The father of I.F.H. was involved in a
bad accident out of state as our hash began and our most positive prayers and
energy are sent to him and our friends. &nbsp;We will keep them in our thoughts
and hearts during this hard time of recovery.<br>
<br>
To our hares for the day Yanksit and the drafted Edgar Allen Ho, we thank you
for your work in providing the trail. &nbsp;To our beermeister Potty, man it’s
good to have you back. &nbsp;To our virgins and our out-of-towners, come on back
every other week! &nbsp;We love you people. &nbsp;To our own Bike-Bitch for his
consistent generosity in the LGC - Thank you brother.<br>
<br>
This coming weekend is Run-A-Muck with &quot;The Original&quot; Orlando Hash
House Harriers. &nbsp;It will be a three day camping trip and BVD will be
represented well.<br>
<br>
Until next hash keep yourselves safe, see you soon.<br>
May the Hash go in Peace.<br>
Suckulater BVD On-Sec.<br>
