Shooter and Sniffah&#146; Birthday Hash <br>
<br>
On Saturday Jan 5th the hounds gathered as planned at Kmart Plaza in Satellite Beach for
the 56th BVD hash. &nbsp;It quickly turned fashion show 2002 as party dresses in many
styles and colors began to appear in accordance with the outfit of the day. &nbsp;(No more
friggen dresses people). <br>
<br>
BVD welcomed visitors Behind Ewe, just Alicia, just Colleen, Gilligan and Garfield. (Rumor
has it that just Alicia is looking for a home hash? &nbsp;BVD would be happy to include
her in our kennel &#150; woof!). &nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome pups. <br>
<br>
S-Wax assumed the reigns with hash cash, Kojak drug out the cool new tanks and tees and
with business done the hares were greeted and sniffed for their 21st birthdays (again).
&nbsp;A chalk talk pursued and the hares were away. &nbsp;Fifteen minutes later the pack
set out with the first stop at Salad Shooter&#146;s mom&#146;s place for an extra credit
of Chocolate and Brandy.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
After the Brandy and chocolate things got messy fast, the pack was on out at different
times and different directions. &nbsp;Short Straw enticed a small pack on a shortcut that
took a wrong turn and added a mile or so to the trail (bad dog). <br>
<br>
The trail headed south through neighborhoods, east across A1A to the beach, north then
west to South Patrick through highways, shiggy and another extra credit (vodka) in the
woods near a paint ball course. &nbsp;Congrats to Just Puke (Bumpy) and his fine ability
of snagging local fruit to create God&#146;s own Screwdrivers-sans ice. <br>
<br>
We were promised a long trail so on-out we went finally checking in at the beer stop and
hearing of our hare&#146;s run in with the local constables. &nbsp;Apparently she was auto
haring a little too quickly ($ 94 worth). <br>
<br>
The hounds found the end behind a vacant building, several strays having to be retrieved
by auto. &nbsp;Eventually the circle got started with Dr. Anus having to do a quick down
down and off to tend to a patient. &nbsp;The group sang, circled, performed accusations
and howled late after the sun had gone down. &nbsp;The hounds voted to put off naming of
just Marilyn for another hash in lieu of our impaired collective thought processes. <br>
<br>
What a hash! &nbsp;Thank you to the hares that worked hard to make it enjoyable and keep
the trail filled with extra credits, twists, turns and surprises. &nbsp;On-out until hash
# 57. <br>
<br>
May the hash go in peace. <br>
