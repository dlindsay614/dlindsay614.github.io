<p ALIGN="CENTER">THE AMERICAS INTERHASH 2001<br>
AUSTIN TEXAS 30 AUG - 01 SEPT</p>
</b><font SIZE="2">

<p></font><font face="Arial" size="3">Well well... All the Austin guys/gals are back in
effect here in good old BVD. We had a <strong>Strong </strong>showing</font><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">:</font><font SIZE="2"></p>
</font><font COLOR="#800080">

<p><font face="Arial">Yanksit, Fireindahole, Without Socks, I'd Fuck Her, Kojak, Mullet,
Hoosier Daddy, and a few oldies Cockpit and Crotchduster.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Let me start by saying how much I love BVD! Ok here are just a few
exciting things/tidbits of knowledge that I and I.F.H. can recall about this Austin
INTERAM thing that we went to in no particular order. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">1. When your plane lands in Texas...make sure you are in <strong>AUSTIN</strong>
<u>not</u><strong> HOUSTON</strong> before you get off the plane. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">2. Don't stand on the 6th floor drinking beer the first night you
get there because everyone thinks that when they are on the elevator going up/down by the
6th floor, they have to stop and bum a beer on their way to the 1st floor ballroom. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">3. Out of Yanksit, Fire, I.F.H. and Without Socks...Without Socks is
the only one who can drink Jagermeister all night long and still feel ok in the morning. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">4. After you live with Yanksit for a few days his farts grow on you
and they even don't smell anymore. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">5. I.F.H. and Fire can clog a toilet after eating chocolate and
drinking coffee. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">6. If you ever go to Austin DO NOT drink Lawnmower beer----YUCK. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">7. Crotchduster looks good when he is all dressed up (I.F.H. wrote
this) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">8. Jacksonville is not GAY...AUSTIN is GAY. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">9. Fire ants and Mud do not make a good on-after venue. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">10. If you are ever in Austin visit the Capitol building it is nice.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">11. When you see about 100+ guys in Speedos at a hotel pool party
and there are no bikinis in sight...<strong>RUN...RUN LIKE THE WIND</strong>, you may even
want to put your hands over your butthole while running...yeah, you better <em>especially
if you are slow!</em> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">12. You will buy anything at these events if the word HASH is on it.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">13. Did I mention Austin is GAY, see #11. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">14. There are people who are with other HASH groups that joined our
email group and they think we have our own soap opera TV show. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">15. I.F.H. has a Palatka name it is WAKeeSHA, and so does WITHOUT
SOCKS it is SUGAR DADDY. (we'll save the explanations for later all Palatkaers know what I
mean by the explanations) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">16. No Mexican women want a man named SHORT STRAW, even for a green
card. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">17. For some reason, all the other non-BVD Hashers called Without
Socks, I.F.H., Yanksit, and Fire &quot;GAY&quot; for wearing the same blue BVD tanktop for
the hash run... excuse me, we're proud of BVD and &quot;We're just 'repra-zentin' (that's
Wakeesha talkin')! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">18. As for I.F.H., she's glad to be away from all the stinky armpits
that clobbered her face every time a male hasher insisted on coming up to hug her. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">19. Fire and I.F.H. are now official members of H5 (<u>H</u>ot <u>H</u>oes
(who hate pathetic come on lines) <u>H</u>ash <u>H</u>ouse <u>H</u>arriettes). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">20. Okay, I'm going to jump out on a limb here and speak for myself
(I.F.H).... Yanksit's farts do NOT lose their smell even after cohabitation... Poor Fire. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Okay, that's it for now. If any of you other INTERAM wankers would
like to add onto this, go right ahead! :) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">And YES -- the most skankest beer I've ever tasted was
LAWNMOWER!&nbsp; Where<br>
in the hell did they cum up with that and how could any microbrewery put<br>
their name on it?</font></p>
