<p></font><font face="Arial">Before this on-sec says a word about BVD hash #4, it must be
mentioned that we have a hashing God among us, better known as Crotch Duster. At our very
first hash, Crotch Duster was honored several times with down-downs. After the third (or
was it the fourth?) beer, he graciously stepped out of the circle and hurled buckets. What
makes him a hashing God is that he continued to sing down-down songs to other people in
the circle--in between breaths of his projectile vomiting! We bow to you oh Godly one.
Okay, enough ass-kissin--on to BVD hash #4. A gaggle of about 30 hashers and virgins met
at the Pineda Plaza. After on-on was called, our slow-moving pack found the true trail
about 15 minutes later and headed north on Wickham Rd. After weaving back forth across
Wickham a couple of times, and missing a photo op, we came up on Yanksit enjoying a brew
at the beer stop. Then we were on-out to the railroad tracks and made our way toward HW
U.S. 1. A small group of hashers paused for the second photo op at the Pineda Crossing Bar
and Grill and stopped in for a beer or two&#151;of course! Happy as can be and full of
beer, they headed out to join the rest of the pack. They stumbled across a couple of
hashers (to include Kojak) trying to find the true trail. Somehow they found the sparsely
-laid flour and headed up US 1. Meanwhile the FRBs who passed up the 2<sup>nd</sup> photo
op and the unplanned beer stop, couldn&#146;t find the end of the trail, so they went back
to the start. One of these lost souls (K-9, was that you?) came by vehicle to find the
rest of the drunken hashers staggering up US 1. With a tip from the hare&#146;s better
half, the pack found the beer near and were on-in to a wooded area with lots of beer and a
block of ice waiting. Many hashers drank heavily in the circle and sat their bare asses on
ice! We drank, we sang, we drank, we sat on ice, we drank and finally headed out to the
on-on-on at the Pineda Crossing. The BVD Hashers virtually took over the bar--dancing,
drinking, singing, Cockpit flashing her tits, hasher women giving each other the
tongue&#133;on-on to BVD Hash #5!! </font>
