<p ALIGN="CENTER">BVD NC/SC HASH 22-24 JUN 01</p>

<p>NOTE : </b><font size="3">The following is an attempt to remember some of the events
that happened to BVD (some DBH3/OH3) folks who went to the NC/SC #8 this past weekend. DO
not bitch about spelling, grammar, and all that other shit. I am a Dr., not a writer. SO
prepare to be taken back in time, and if you remember anything from this account, remember
that Potty is Tooth Fairy&#146;s Bitch!</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p></font><font size="3">On 22 Jun 01 Slow Poker, S-Wax, Salad Shooter, Dr. Without Socks,
and I.F.H left Brevard, FL. and Just Puke, Potty Flavor, Erectorpad, and Gilligan left
Daytona Beach, FL. The plan was for the Brevard folks to meet the Daytona folks in
Daytona. Well right off the plans changed. Someone in their (Daytona) group got hungry so
they left early and we (Brevard) decided just to meet up in Jacksonville, cuz we had to
get Short Straw. As the Brevard folks waited at the exit for the light to turn green, IFH
was startled as a huge &#145;clothed&#146; gorilla came up and scared her. As you can
guess Just Puke and the Daytona crew had arrived. Eventually we made it to Short
Straw&#146;s &#145;per diem&#146; pad. After all the girls clogged his pipes - Potty,
Socks, and Slow Poker were stuck as the drivers. We almost all bought the farm when Potty
decided to pass a truck, which was going 50 mph in the far left hand lane on 95 (Fuckin
Fuck&#133;,) on the left side emergency lane. Then we had a gas break, and Potty got lost
leaving the gas station. Eventually after about 5 hours we arrived at Hardee
&quot;GHETTO&quot; ville SC. After a brief pee/poop/eat break at Burger King (which we saw
Chippendale and Sperm Burp) we went to the place which would be home for the next couple
of days. Then we realized that Potty and the Daytona gang were not behind us, you guessed
it, Potty got lost again. Sherwood Plantation was great, but BVD village made it that way.
After all the tents were erected, we decided to start drinking. IFH stepped in dog shit.
It began to rain and then Slow Poker made a command decision to move BVD village. See
since we are all really smart hashers we built the first BVD village on the lowest spot on
the whole campsite. After the move we continued to drink beer. Then we noticed that Slow
Poker&#146;s cup now says &quot;&#133;K More&#133; Bitch Less&quot; Where did the DRIN go?
Then like a beacon of light the CTrH3 bus arrived. All I can say is Potty and I decided
that BVD needs an airplane, who is the Haberdasher????</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p></font><font size="3">As the night went on, Salad got thrown in the pool (inflatable
child pool) and lost her underwear to Doofus (or did she give it to him, my notes and
memory are drawing a blank). It is at this point in this narrative that I would like to
bring something out of the BVD closet&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;..Yeah that&#146;s right
POTTY. See readers, it was at this point after dinner that Potty met a &#145;friend&#146;.
His name was Tooth Fairy. After the BVDers saw the relationship that began to blossom
after about 10-15 minutes between Potty and Tooth, we decided that there needed to be a
divorce (renaming) So be it known &#145;un&#146; officially (our RA was not there) Potty
Flavor is now TOOTH FAIRY&#146;S BITCH. Then Erector showed why she is the best naked girl
from any hash when she did a table dance for the masses. Slow Poker began to drink heavily
at this point in the night, which would lead to him trying to sleep, but of course we
would not let him. It was at this time that Socks and Short Straw were able to see one of
the many sex scenes of the weekend. As we watched two hot lesbians making out in the
kiddie pool, Short Straw told me how much he loved hashing, and of course I agreed with
him. Unfortunately IFH had the camera and there was no way I was going to go find her and
get it, so that moment <b>will not</b> be shared visually through pictures. Something came
up about IFH and S-Wax&#146;s nipples. Acorns and Walnuts???? Potty is still gay at this
point.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p></font><font size="3">Then we noticed S-Wax and Slow Poker had been gone for about a
half an hour. When they returned S-Wax&#146;s face was very red &#150; as told by Salad
Shooter. See Short Straw and I were still oogling over the lesbians, gosh Yanksit wish ya
would have been there for it. Then I think (?) we did a shooting star hash. NO BEER &#150;
JUST SHOTS. Puke got naked, Potty exclaimed something about a hairy gorilla. IFH was Pat
Benatar, we saw our way with glow sticks. IFH and I went back to the hotel, since we were
hotel people not camping people.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p></font><font size="3">On 23 Jun 01 (Sat), The hotel people arrived pumped and ready for
day 2 of NC/SC. On the way IFH and Socks called Yanksit at 8:30AM to invite him and Fire
to the NC/SC hash &#150; for some reason they did not want to go. It all started with
Gilligan waking up wondering who puked in his tent. Guess who it was&#133;..it was
Gilligan himself. After the green (literally) eggs, we hashed for about 1 mile. Then came
the part of the day everyone was waiting for &#150; PUB CRAWL IN SAVANNAH!!!!!</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p></font><font size="3">With 4 minivans and a CTrH3 school bus that had 70 people on it
we headed for Savannah. The bus was definitely the best automobile in the caravan. Except
for when we slammed on the breaks and everybody spilled their beer (and IFH &amp; Cockpit
got wrist cuts). It was around here when we met Scarlet &quot;NOT ALL THERE-AH.&quot; She
was the one wearing the great Southern Belle dress that the dog pissed on. After the
tampon string moonings, we finally stopped to begin the pub crawl. 3 Bars were included in
the festivities. I.E. passed out and people put their nuts and pee-pees on his lips and
took pictures. Cockpit and I watched 2 people having sex in the bathroom. Luckily we did
not fall off the toilet cuz it was worth the near death experience. Gilligan was finally
persuaded by me to begin drinking since he was feeling too bad from the night before,
remember the puking in the sleeping bag. All he had to do was touch IFH&#146;s boobies.
IFH &#150; <b>I</b> <b>F</b>ondled <b>H</b>er. IFH left her bra on the CTrH3 bus after
Crotchduster wore it for the remainder of the day. We harassed some girl scouts downtown.
Once we got back to the plantation we did down downs. Puke threw about 10 people in the
pool. Puke called Salad into the circle for having the same name as someone else. Licker
and NOT ALL THERE-AH were &#145;doing their own thing&#146; which made the circle
interesting. It was at this point I realized Just Eileen never even came to the NC/SC, and
she paid!!!!!</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p></font><font size="3">After a great shrimp dinner, Without Socks lost his Citadel ring.
CTrH3 kept setting off a cannon thanks to Mountain Yak. Scarlet NOT ALL THERE-AH &#150;
&quot;Cock a doodle dooo.&quot; Crotchduster made a lame attempt to jump the fire and fell
in, then went to the hospital with IFH&#146;s bra still on . After some stitches he
returned. Then the night ended.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p></font><font size="3">On 24 Jun 01, (Sun) Slow Poker found Sock&#146;s ring, and Salad
lost an earring. Salad also started slamming mimosas around 8 AM. The hotel hashers
arrived and we all ate MceeeeDs! Gotta love the golden arches for making hangover food. OK
this is getting long, fingers hurt, must go on naked lesbians must go on&#133;..WAIT let
me get back on track. Sunday morning we participated in Gay (easy Potty) Olympics, put on
by Tinky Winky. These were awesome! Tinky is definitely the man (I think, see he wore a
great dress during the pub crawl- well whatever back to the story) Erector and Potty
participated in dickball, Erector won the GOLD, Potty well he just was Potty (F beep beep
beep). Potty, Socks, Puke, Slow Poker, and Erector participated in Izzy Dizzy. We got the
BRONZE. IFH and Short Straw played know your partner. Short Straw&#146;s was not firm
enough, his butt that is! Erector also won the partner painting game. Then she left her
boob print on the CTrH3 bus. Oh yeah Potty was still gay. As we broke down BVD village,
pizza arrived. Then we bid NC/SC adieu, and headed home. Well that&#146;s when the fun
started. Slow Poker&#146;s car had trouble with its tires. So they pulled off the side of
I95. As Short Straw, the minority (the Mexican of the group), changed the tire, Salad
popped open a beer. LUSH!!! Eventually everyone made it home&#133;I think. And in the end
I only have a few questions. 

<ol>
  <li>Did Greg Loose Anus drive his dirt bike home?</li>
  <li>Slow Poker, there was a rumor that you never showered?</li>
  <li>Potty, is IT true?</li>
  <li>Why can&#146;t NC/SC be once a month because a great time was had by all&#133; everyone
    there was &quot;good shit&quot;!</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well that was my lame attempt to recreate the events of this past weekend for everyone.
Everyone should laugh after they read this. If anything makes you mad in the above
narrative, you know that you&#146;re OVERREACTING!!!!</p>
