Full Moon<br>
November 10th, 2003</b></font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Dateline - Monday, 11-10-03. The troops
assembled at Camp Kojak at 18:30<br>
for a 3 mile full battle gear run to the front lines on a gale force evening.<br>
Well, actually, this motley crew sauntered (real Marines don't saunter)<br>
On-In in practically their skivvies for an excuse to drink beer.<br>
<br>
Many of the Recruits were new to me so forgive me if your name is not included
in the<br>
ranks. There was: Kojak, Lollipop, Happy Meal, Kittylingus (late show),<br>
newly engaged In My Mouth and Million Buck Phuck (not Golden Shower),<br>
Moaner Boner (never leave camp), Mullet, Hoosier Daddy, Surf, Skybox, I'd Do It<br>
With Her, Shirley Tinkle, Slow Poker, Snatch Wax, Pocket Rocket, CPA,<br>
Krusty Kreme, BC (late), Rub Her
Mound, Smells Like Fish,
Tastes Like Fish,<br>
Scrub Jay, a gaggle of virgins and me ..Bike Bitch.<br>
<br>
We were rousted by Lieutenant Lollipop (it just sounds good)<br>
for our marching orders and chalk talk and assembled in two's.<br>
The secret code was laid out and we were On-Out.<br>
<br>
As in all military operations
things don't always go according to plan.<br>
The expected full moon was
supposed to light our way and expose our course<br>
of attack but decided to go
into stealth mode. We were told to look by streetlights for our<br>
deliverance and did thus. The FRB's did their best to locate the trail but it
appears<br>
that the availability of flour must be at a premium during this time of
war<br>
and locating the &quot;plops&quot; was a feat worthy of LRRP (Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol).<br>
No matter. We cried, &quot;Semper Fi !&quot; and
trod On-On against all adversity.<br>
<br>
The brilliant FRB's excelled in finding True Trail until they realized that<br>
they weren't as smart as they thought they were when the Count Back Six was seen.<br>
Much discussion as to which plop was #6 and much &quot;which way ?&quot; ensued as<br>
we eventually faced the
direction of the beach. I guess it was the allure my glow<br>
stick (no, not that you filthy thing) but Hashers kept asking me for directions<br>
thinking I had a clue. I informed them that, &quot;I'm not from Over the Bridge.&quot;<br>
which they
found&nbsp; amusing. I'm just a poor landlubber and not a Beech Nut.<br>
<br>
As we approached A1A we detoured through a construction site and became<br>
disoriented. Some insisted that there was a Beach Access and the trail must go that way.<br>
I insisted that there were words to the effect of no beach trail and instead<br>
found True Trail through a culvert. Listening is VERY important at Chalk<br>
Talk even if you're not a virgin. I decide to whine about no full moon in<br>
site at this point and was shown TWO !<br>
Bad News: I saw the craters on Slow &quot;Luna&quot; Poker up close.<br>
Good News: I saw the beautiful valleys of
a
Harriette I'm not sure of...<br>
...and definitely not close enough.<br>
<br>
Then came the glorious BEER NEAR sign !<br>
But someone must tell Lieutenant Lollipop that BN means within<br>
a&nbsp; mile, preferably within 50 feet.&nbsp; All returned to base having
developed a<br>
warrior worthy thirst and hunger. A circle was formed and addressed by<br>
Commandant Kojak. Letters were read and congratulations to THE CORPS were<br>
extolled. A note of thanks was given for Cumsicle's duty in the desert and<br>
a virgin's daughter who had just entered the Marines. I was forced (totally<br>
against my will) to do a Down-Down for referring to a soldiers weapon as a<br>
&quot;gun&quot;. I deserved that one. The circle was entertained by a
dancing<br>
Hamster ( Kojak couldn't afford a Bulldog ) as we sang the Marine Corps Anthem.<br>
<br>
The chow was On-On and we all enjoyed a sumptuous and very gracious feast with<br>
no threat of KP duty. Finally a USMC cake was brought out. By tradition<br>
the first piece was given to the youngest Marine (Collin) and the second to<br>
the oldest (not counting the cutter of the cake) Marine (more like a cowardly<br>
draft dodger) Bike Bitch. A truly honorable night was had.<br>
The troops dispersed to fight another day.<br>
May the hash go in peace, May the hash get
a piece,<br>
<br>
BUT IT'S THE MARINES THAT KEEP THE PEACE !<br>
&nbsp;OOH-RAH ! SEMPER
FIDELIS!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; On-Out, Bike Bitch<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
And when the moon did show it was a glorious, breezy evening.&nbsp; And thanks
to<br>
all of you for joining us and making this the best USMC Birthday celebration<br>
we have had since we left the Foreign Service.<br>
<br>
Fantastic job BB.&nbsp; Thanks.<br>
<br>
ON ONnn,<br>
