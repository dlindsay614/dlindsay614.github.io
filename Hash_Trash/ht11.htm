<p>The beginning of BVD H3 #11 had an interesting twist. The meeting point was the Malabar
Post Office parking lot, but I guess we were told to move our asses elsewhere&#133;and we
did&#133;one block west&#133;and we liked it&#133;and there was much rejoicing. After a
very long, long, long, detailed, did I say long, chalk talk, compliments of Sir Flatulot,
the pack was off! We immediately dashed off into the thicket and there we stayed for the
next couple of hours. The trail consisted of paths through palmettos, and trees. We did
the duck, weave and hop-over method of running trail. Before long (2 or 3 miles, but
who&#146;s counting), we stumbled into the half-way beer stop. Mullet came bounding in
with blood oozing down both legs. Known for short-cutting, he decided to do the same on
this trail but ran into some pretty mean palmettos. We all had a good laugh, finished a
cold one and were on-out again, but the laughs were on us. This time, we ran into some
thick, over-grown trail. You know it&#146;s gonna be challenging when the hares use toilet
paper to mark the trail! The FRBs (front running bastards) were long gone when about 8 or
so SRBs (slow running bastards) experienced a scene from the Blair Witch Project. Somehow,
this small pack got turned around and ran part of the trail twice. The second time around,
we (yes, I hate to admit that I was part of this gaggle of misfits) still couldn&#146;t
find the trail. Then, Tumbalina pops out of the trees (cumming from who knows where) and
says, &quot;Here&#146;s the trail,&quot; without a pause in her stride. We were on down
the road, through a neighborhood, and back into the woods and down more trails. About two
miles later (again, who&#146;s counting, not me), with muddy, bloody legs, we saw BEER
NEAR and were on-back to where we started. We circled up for the traditional down-downs.
First we sang to 6 virgins, then two visitors (Pussy Gourmet &amp; Without Socks), the
hares sat on ice, Mullet drank for turning his legs into hamburger, Butt Wrangler drank
for shaving his head, Da-Shit sat on ice because Sir Flatulot wanted to sit on ice with
someone who didn&#146;t have a hairy butt, Just Thomas drank for wearing a marathon
T-shirt, Hoosier was honored for cumming in DFL (dead fucking last), Tumbalina sat on
ice&#133;just because, Sir Flatulot sat on ice with a virgin who wore a water pack (did
anyone notice that Sir Flat sat on ice A LOT), Yanksit sat on ice for farting on trail,
Sissy Bitch drank for peeing on someone&#146;s tires, Edgar Allen Ho was honored for doing
Moaner (doing what, you might ask), Without Socks and his newly wed wife sat on ice for
competing on trail, AND Blowfish came in the circle because he has a big mouth (?). We
named Just Heidi &quot;Blow Job Lips.&quot; Cum Chum gave the HUYA (head up your ass)
award to Tumbalina for putting up with everyone&#146;s crap. With the circle done, we
continued our celebration, only to be interrupted by a curious police officer (called in
by a friendly neighbor). Once he discovered that we were &quot;runners&quot; and not a
bunch of crazy kids (he don&#146;t know us do he?), he was on-out. That about does it for
BVD H3 hash #11. </font>
