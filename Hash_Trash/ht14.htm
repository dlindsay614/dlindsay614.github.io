<p>BVD H3 hash #14 began with clouds overhead, threatening rain at any moment. No
matter&#151;weather, good or bad, makes no difference to a pack of beer-thirsty hounds.
Dressed in an array of jungle boogie outfits, the pack was off in a not so timely manner,
as usual. Instead of heading toward the wooded area as we all expected, the trail took us
back up South Dr. toward Wickham Rd. As soon as the FRBs yelled on-on, the rain came down
in buckets. There&#146;s nothing better than hashing in the rain! The trail headed across
Wickham Rd and after a short jaunt through a housing area, we ducked into the woods and
found an awesome trail. By this time, the pack had split up into the FRBs and SWBs.
Another couple of miles and the FRBs found themselves&#133;what&#146;s this&#133;back
where we started??!! We found out later from the hare that we ran the trail
backwards&#151;not a big deal in the world of hashing&#151;except that we missed the beer
stop!!! Now, the SWBs on the other hand, had no trouble at all finding the beer stop.
Meanwhile, the FRBs stood around scratching their, umm, heads, who said head, I&#146;ll
take some of that! Anyway, someone remembered hearing our hare Bitch Be Gone mention
something about directions left on our cars, which is what they did. We were happy as
could be since the end was approximately one mile up the road at Bitch Be Gone&#146;s love
palace and of course, there would be beer. But NO, it wasn&#146;t going to be that easy.
The hares were still at the beer stop with the SWBs and ALL the beer (keg &amp; cans).
Bitch&#146;s house was open (??) so we all went in and made ourselves at home to include
drinking all the beer we could find (unfortunately, only a couple of cans). Strangely
enough, the pizzas that Sky Box ordered arrived before the hares, but we were more than
happy to accept them. About 20 or so minutes later, the rest of the pack, along with the
hares, began to arrive. With the keg flowing, we circled up for the down-downs. First were
four virgins, then the hares (except for Sky Box who disappeared). More down-downs for the
FRBs, Surf, Assbackwards, Thor the Wanker, and Otis. Our very own hash doctor, Golden
Shower, did a down-down, then all the visitors from Orlando, Daytona, California, and
finally two original Spaced Coast Hashers visited the circle. Nabob and Kojak did the
circle because they hashed together years ago in some unknown country (it really is known,
I just don&#146;t know where they hashed). Assbackwards awarded the HUYA to our hare,
Bitch Be Gone, I believe for messing up the trail. Finally, we had accusations where a
whole mess of people did down-downs for various reasons and of course, the group was
totally out of control at this point. With the circle closed, the group devoured the
pizzas, and in no time, finished the keg. So, a very sober Pussy Gourmet and I volunteered
to be the beer fairies. The local Stop N&#146; Go clerk was quite surprised when two
ladies carried 10 cases of beer (or so, I can&#146;t remember how many) to the register.
We were on-back to Bitch&#146;s house where the party continued with music, dancing, and
the occasional hasher being thrown in the pool. I heard that Red Hot Anal Pepper wrapped
Edgar Allan Ho in toilet paper (voluntarily) and then he was thrown in the pool
(involuntarily). What fun we have! If you get a chance, ask Party Hats about her
testicular weight experiment. Hats off (or tops off) to Bitch Be Gone for opening up his
pad to a bunch of drunks!</font>
