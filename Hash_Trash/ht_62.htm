Milk-N-Cookies Hash<br>
July 10th, 2005</b></font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>It was a beautiful Sunday but the threat of
Dennis raining on our parade</b></font><b><font size="3"><br>
kept the fair weather hashers home. So we had a small but hardy group with</font></b>
<b><font size="3">us.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Hares: Goldie Licks and Short Straw<br>
Hounds: Cockpit, LMAU, Just Puke, Harry Cheeseballs, Kittylingus, Slow Poker,<br>
Shop Teacher (pulled up on his chopper) and Dr. Anus.<br>
&nbsp;Also dragged here against her will, Gator Bait.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Started off with a nice bi-lingual chalk
talk next to the Winn Dixie at<br>
Barnes and Murrel. Lots of symbols depicting animal life.<br>
Ooh wee sounds like we may be going off road.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Ok Runners out. Huh isn�t it Walkers out?
Trust the Hares. Ok so runners<br>
take off heading west and then its walkers out. Y�all head south till you<br>
hit Micky D�s and look for the intersection.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Lots of stuff happened here but being Hares
and having to get to the 1st<br>
beer check we had to wait to hear about it.<br>
<br>
Poor Puke got assaulted by a beer can (must have been revenge) and was<br>
unable to do trail with his twisted ankle. He jumped in the back of the beer<br>
truck and off we went down Barnes. We let Goldie jump out and mark the true<br>
trails on the dry side of the ditches and then we pulled into storage units<br>
and hustled to the back with BEER to wait for the hounds.<br>
<br>
Hark are those whistles we hear? Yes indeedy, but they were still far off so<br>
open up another brewski and tell some more lies to each other. It seemed like<br>
forever but finally a hound shows up. Gee it�s none other than Dr. Anus, hobbling in<br>
and dry as a bone. Damn it! there were water crossings, how he�d get around<br>
those? Next Kitty and Gator Bait both looking pretty rank with the smell to<br>
match (I knew there were water crossings) and then Harry Cheeseballs,<br>
looking like he had a pretty good swim. Shop Teacher showed up mildly wet<br>
then the girls and SP.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">It seems that Dr. Anus built a small bridge
for the 1st water crossing but<br>
when Shop Teacher went to use it, well lets just say the weight limit was<br>
exceeded and a KER-SPLASH insued. The rest of the pack wandered up and down<br>
the shore looking for an easier way to cross (not likely) so they just<br>
sucked it up and waded thru (only knee deep). They then crossed Barnes only<br>
to see trail went on the other side of another Water Crossing. Dr. (Lighter<br>
than Air) Anus takes a running start and vaults the water only to come down<br>
hard on his knee (thus the hobbling) but makes it and continues. Kitty<br>
thinks that�s pretty easy so he tries (oops! weight factor again). He hits<br>
the far back only to slide back into the ditch. Harry tries, Harry Fails and<br>
lands mid crossing (this one chest high). The rest are cowards and range<br>
adding another .5 miles to their trail. Oh well beer is cold and it�s a<br>
lovely spot in the woods (see LMAUs pics) On-out.<br>
<br>
Everyone heads back to the road and to a trailhead while Shorty takes off<br>
the back way to meet the</font></b> <b><font size="3">pack at the 2nd beer
check.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Nice little trail with a CB 4 at the old
beer check. Well Shorty�s waiting<br>
under this awesome shade tree when Dr. Anus (imagine that) runs on by<br>
followed shortly by Slow Poker (how the hell did that happen). They run<br>
into a CB 2 BC. (Anus not listening to chalk talk starts to run back to<br>
the 1st beer check. Slow Poker is adamant that its count 2 and look for the<br>
BC. Oops Shorty is spotted so Anus comes on back. <br>
<br>
The girls had already called that they were going to wait by the Photo � Op.<br>
So we�re waiting for</font></b> <b><font size="3">Harry to show up. Everyone
crouches down as he runs by to let him hit<br>
the</font></b> <b><font size="3">CB 2 BC. After a minute it�s what the heck.
And we spot him on the ridge,</font></b><b><font size="3"><br>
We holler and whistle to get his ass back. He tells us he thought it was a</font></b>
<b><font size="3">CB 0.<br>
Whatever. Pack Away Turkey Eagle split coming up. Eagles will be</font></b> <b><font size="3">rewarded<br>
&nbsp;with a shorter but harder trail. Everyone says they are going</font></b> <b><font size="3">Eagle.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">So Shorty grabs the remaining beer and back
track to the trail head only to</font></b> <b><font size="3">hear Dr. A coming<br>
up behind him. Why the hell aren�t you doing Eagle? This </font></b><b><font size="3">is
the Turkey trail. Where was the split?<br>
Back at the gate that you had to</font></b> <b><font size="3">go around. <br>
I didn�t go around anything I went between the rails (skinny</font></b> <b><font size="3">fu&amp;k).<br>
&nbsp;Well idiot you were standing on the T E split. Go back and try</font></b> <b><font size="3">again.
So I continue on<br>
my way and he goes back. Well here we are on Barnes</font></b><b><font size="3">
blvd on the other side of the a ditch.<br>
Slow Poker and Harry are on the other side. Guys come on over it�s not that
deep.<br>
They try pole vaulting can�t quite get it so Harry just jumps in and Slow
Poker follows</font></b> <b><font size="3">his lead.<br>
They take off on trail. Dr. Anus shows up 5 minutes later and </font></b><b><font size="3">thinks
for a second or 2 and<br>
grabs the 2 x 4 and trys the pole vaulting (god damn lighter than Air fuck).<br>
I thought for sure he�d get wet on this one. Oh no he just sails along
skimming the top of the water.<br>
And off he goes to</font></b> <b><font size="3">reel in the other 2. But wait
where�s Kitty, shop teacher and Gator bait.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">The idiots like Anus missed the T E split
and had made it almost all the way</font></b> <b><font size="3">back to the 1st
BC (not on trail).<br>
Shorty boy scouted and got them to the </font></b><b><font size="3">end.<br>
<br>
Circle up boy and girls. Milk and Cookies for everyone (apparently</font></b> <b><font size="3">some
IDIOT called us the<br>
Milk and Cookie hash so that�s what we served).</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Ice was set out (Damn you Kojak for giving
SP that box) and the normal accusations ensued.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Overall @ 4miles of trail 5 if you tried to
range around crossings and ignore T E splits.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Maggies Picture says it all �This trail
was RUFF, I tell you Ruff�</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>As always if I�m lying I�m dying<br>
<br>
On-Out, Short Straw</b></font></p>
