  <font face="Arial" size="3">The Hash started out at the Malabar Post office,
  where
  much to our delight we had some unexpected &quot;too long&nbsp;betweener's&quot;...nice
  to see you out again Moaner Boner, Potty Flavor, Cock Gobbler and Fatty!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Oh, can't forget our hares, Just Puke and Sir Flatulot (Fatty).</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="3">We had 25 fantastic hashers...very nice to see
  some virgins: Just Jacques, Just Sharilyn and Just Tanya (who really was a virgin at St. Patty's
  day but oh well...) and visitors, Fu*king Goofy (OH3), Way beyond Gay (or was that
  way gay?!), Speedy,&nbsp; and Gilligan (is Gilligan really a visitor?!)</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="3">Okay now down to the good stuff...after consuming
  some beverages and a lovely rendition of Father Abraham lead by our wonderful Song Miester,
  IFH, everyone was on out...rumor has it at the beginning we had some unhappy
  cattle...Just Robin suggested that the hares, Puke and Fatty, may have stopped to fornicate with
  them?!&nbsp; Since I didn't do trail I only know what I heard...so here
  goes...</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="3">Fatty told Puke no way would BVD do the water
  crossing especially after they had seen a gator and water moccasin's but Puke
  insisted on doing it anyway...long story short, Edgar Allen Ho was the only
  person other then Puke that actually saw the crossing, Puke got lost on his
  own trail (had to find his trail to get back out) and got snagged by both
  Edgar and Gilligan...speaking of Gilligan, who got lost on trail...Fatty saw
  Gilligan, thought he was caught, even was polite enough to wave to Gilligan
  (but yet Gilligan stayed lost - I don't understand that)...We almost had to
  send out a search party for Puke since just about everyone was On-In before he
  even made it to the end, but low and behold he finally came straggling in...
  ...and covered with mud no less!</font>

<div>
  <font face="Arial">We had a lovely little dog fest with Sophia,
  Joe and Buddy joining the hash for this week...the keg was tapped and eventually
  the circle started...Down-Down's for the hares (great job), then Erector
  showed up so we did a quick swing-low fake out, then it was the &quot;out of
  towner's&quot; followed by the &quot;too long betweener's&quot;....welcum back Lollipop, Moaner
  Boner, Potty Flavor &amp; Cock Gobbler... The FRB's - IFH and Dr. Anus
  &amp;&nbsp; DFL - Bike Bitch, a special down-down for
  Biker Frank (Erector's Biker friend)......we also had a naming...it took a good 30 minutes or
  so and we had lot's of good names
  tossed out, such as...Call Girl, Poke-her-hiness (or something like that),
  etc...Just Jessica was finally named....Zam-Bone-Me . This
  was due to the way she gyrated on, and cleaned the ice as she waited for the
  pack to cum up with a name everyone could agree on.&nbsp; ....Welcum to BVD
  Zamboneme...now that you are named, will Thorin come out and PLAY??? Our Hash
  Horn lost his horn... ...again! and had to do his down-down out of it! The
  HUYA was passed to Just Puke for being snared twice in almost as many runs and
  for getting lost on his own trail. There seemed to be a lot of
  head (Head! who said head...) gear in the circle... ...a little respect please!<br>
  <span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think there were a few more down-downs after that but I don't recall, then just as I was getting all
  excited that my sensitive butt hadn't been on the ice, it happened...Yanksit
  called me onto the ice (for what, I had not a clue), I thought for sure it was
  going to be a unemployment down down, but nope...he turned the circle over to
  Slow Poker (what was he thinking)....as Slow Poker got down on his knee and
  popped the question...and me, being the cold hearted bitch that I am, knowing
  that his fear was that I would say <i>no</i>...stopped and thought about the
  question...hmm, what should a girl do?!?!&nbsp; tick, tock, tick, tock...let's
  see, unemployment, he said I don't really have to work...I would be a fool to
  say <i>NO</i>...but then again, you have the St. Patty's day hash...oh heck, how
  could I say no to the man...so, of course I said <i>YES</i>, and his ass best get on
  that ice with me!&nbsp; So, now we belong to a small and special hash group
  along with Yanksit and
  Fire...we are one of few couples crazy enough to get engaged
  in the circle...but hey, aren't we all family?!</font>

  <font face="Arial" size="3"><br>
  Speaking of family...cuming soon to a hash near you...A HASH FAMILY WEDDING,
  with Papa Kojak officiating (don't know when but eventually)...</font>

  <font face="Arial" size="3">Oh, then the circle ended, we finished the keg and
  everyone dispersed... ...we understand the Gay Cottage was hopping well into
  the night!</font>

  <font face="Arial" size="3">A final thought (I have to get the Springer quotes
  in while I can... guess what I have been watching with my time off?!), it was
  really great seeing the hashers come back who have been gone for so long,
  Moaner and Potty...&nbsp; we would love to see Hoosier, Mullet and Red Hot
  back again too....</font>

  your Hash flag arrived in GRAND FASHION at the end of the circle, entering the
  parade grounds prominently displayed from its captors vehicle. He said that
  since you didn't care enough to come and get him, he is not sure he wants to
  come back home...&nbsp; ...better be getting that porn channel?!</font>
