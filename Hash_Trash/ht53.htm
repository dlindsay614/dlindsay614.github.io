Hares: Short Straw, Suck-U-Later, Bike Bitch, &amp; Dick Sniffer<br>
Location: Ichabod's Beachside - Indialantic<br>
Date: 24 Nov 01 // Hares &amp; Hounds: 37<br>
Weather: 69ºF + 9ºF Overcast<br>
<br>
The group met at Ichabod's Beachside at 2:00 for the start of Saturday's hash.<br>
We had 15 BVD virgins, and 4 out-of-towners showed up.<br>
Just Kim, Just Amy, Just Robin, Just Francesca, Just Marilyn, Just Anne,<br>
Just Ronin, Just Brett, Just Mareva, Just Anthony, and Just Josh<br>
Watch'em Wiggle came from the Tampa area, Down Boy came from TBH3,<br>
Tooth Fairy was down from the Savannah H3, and Just Greg who is stationed<br>
at Patrick but has been hashing with Orlando came to join us.<br>
<br>
Saturdays hash was a long one @ about 5 miles (or so it seemed).<br>
The trail was a combination of live and pre-laid.<br>
After the chalk talk, three of the hares went off in different directions.<br>
20 minutes, and a round of Father Abraham later, and the pack was On-Out.<br>
I can't recall a Hash in recent memory where the pack was so fired up about<br>
catching the hares. Hmmm... ...maybe it was the three virgin hares.<br>
<br>
The trail immediately started with a YBF that caught a few Hashers and then<br>
proceeded west behind Eckerd's and down Paradise Blvd.<br>
When the trail back markers, Slow Poker, S-Wax, Just Robin, Just Amy,<br>
and Just Marilyn got to the first EC I figured we would find nothing but<br>
a dead carcass. But low and behold, the pack, in their zeal to catch the hares<br>
had passed the well-marked EC... ...without even touching the bottle.<br>
The back markers enjoyed a shot of Jim Bean, grabbed the bottle,<br>
and ran! (o.k., stumbled would be more appropriate!)<br>
<br>
There appeared to be an YBF to the left on Riverside as the pack was soon<br>
On-Right and heading North on Riverside Blvd. The trail went straight for<br>
quite a ways before we found a C.B. 2 (Only 2?, that was a surprise).<br>
We found the trail again which sent us heading East down a utility<br>
easement. Finally we ran into some other hashers. It was Erector Pad<br>
and Just Cindy playing with themselves (and some bottle rockets) on trail.<br>
I guess they wanted to make sure we found the second EC which<br>
was now a mostly empty bottle of tequila with the obligatory<br>
limes and salt. After we all partook in the EC we were On-Out again.<br>
<br>
This part of the trail was heavily laden with Checks, Circle Jerks, and<br>
hash marks everywhere. After a short while of walking around in<br>
circles we heard a familiar call, it was our impromptu Trailmiester,<br>
Just Puke. He led us out of our hilly hell and pointed us in the<br>
direction of the beer check. The trail proceeded through a trailer court<br>
and into the parking lot behind the Fire Department to the beer check.<br>
<br>
Earlier, the three running Hares had converged on the agreeed</big><br>
<big>upon location for the beer check only to find no beer!</big><br>
<big>As the Hares looked back to the trail in horror, Tooth Fairy</big> <big>came</big><br>
<big>running out of the trailer park. The Hares, not realizing Dick Sniffer</big><br>
<big>was out somewhere brewing up the beer, stood by at the missing check<br>
for the imminent snare and got a good grip on their shorts just in case.<br>
<br>
<em>(Just a little additional note about the &quot;Snaring&quot; at the beer check.<br>
I was called the morning of the Hash and was informed by<br>
Salad Shooter that she would also be helping Hare due to the fact<br>
that she was cooking Tooth Fairy a breakfast of monumental proportions.<br>
I suggested that she also try and wear his ass out before the start.<br>
Obviously her definition and my definition of wearing somebody out<br>
differ a little. That dude was fresh as a daisy rounding the corner to<br>
catch up to the 3 Fat Guys, who were looking for the beer at the<br>
supposed beer check - Short Straw).</em><br>
<br>
After snaring the three Hares, Tooth went on to tackle Sniffer's car as she<br>
rounded the corner to drop off the beer.<br>
<br>
Thank you to Tooth Fairy for catching the Hares at the beer check and<br>
letting them continue with their pants still on (No really, THANKS Tooth)!!!!<br>
<br>
<em>(So excellent Hounding by tooth (or poor haring by us). Cudos.<br>
I will have to discuss with Shooter her methods for wearing a person<br>
out the next time I'm haring. Obviously something is lacking - Short Straw).</em><br>
<br>
From there the trail went to a crossover and onto the beach,<br>
North for a ways then back over another crossover to A1A uneventfully.<br>
(Did the hares even see the beach? The only marks we on the crossovers!)<br>
<br>
<em>(As for Hares touching beach, the only sand I saw was before the trailer park<br>
so the answer would be no. The co-hares handled that section.<br>
Yep tide tables were consulted and high tide it was - Short Straw). </em><br>
<br>
Most of us who were at the beer check decided to just head North on A1A.<br>
Soon we were back on trail and heading suspiciously towards<br>
Short Straws pad. To my surprise we ran past his place and following the<br>
True Trail marks ended up back near Riverside Blvd. at Lake<br>
Oceanside Village (Construction site).<br>
<br>
After a bit of scouting for some lost virgins everyone was at the huge circle.<br>
The circle and namings were pretty standard, with Just John becoming<br>
Dr. Anus and Just Don becoming Ass Packet, with one notable exception.<br>
Ass Packet's virgin, Just Kim, immediately started going down on<br>
Ass Packet as he sat on the ice for his naming. Needless to say, BVD<br>
had one more naming this hash, Just Kim became Circle Blow.<br>
We had a visit from a local constable who had a report of a bunch of<br>
kids drinking. Once he realized we weren't kids but just moral degenerates,<br>
he let us finish our ritual. We invited the nice officer to join us for a down-down of
water, <br>
but he was afraid he would not be able to chug fast enough and <br>
didn't want to embarass himself! The Songmiester led us in a round of Swing Low<br>
and the Circle was closed. <br>
<br>
Most of the group then headed to Short Straw's to chow down on some<br>
more turkey and fixens. Once again...Slow Poker's ride broke down<br>
and under the direction of Edgar Allen Ho, Just Puke, Ass Packet and S-Wax<br>
changed a tire that was until Just Puke and S-Wax threatened Edgar with bodily harm<br>
if he didn't leave! Oops, forgot the best part...the tire was put on the car wrong so<br>
Down Boy helped change the tire again...thanks to all that helped S-Wax<br>
(that does not include Edgar)!!!<br>
