</font><font face="Arial">Hares: Yanksit &amp; Without Socks<br>

Ok here it goes let&#146;s see what myself and I.F.H. can remember from yesterday&#146;s
hash.<br>
The hash started at 3:30 for the hares because it was the first time Yanksit actually
showed me the trail.<br>
So after a really quick drive through of the &quot;trail&quot; I assured Yanksit that I
was totally clueless and he of course<br>
came back with a resounding, &quot;Me too,&quot; and then we realized that the trail was
going to be great.<br>
So we proceeded to go to the start at Charlie and Jake&#146;s. </font></font></p>
<font size="3">

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial">There were a lot of hashers: Yanksit &amp; Without
    Socks (hares), Fireindahole, I.F.H., Erectorpad, Potty Flavor,<br>
    Just Puke, Short Straw, Edgar Allen Ho, Just Jay, Delta Dildo, Gym Nasty, Just Duane, Just
    Shoe,<br>
    Just Richard, Kojak, another old guy (older than Kojak), some new tall guy maybe his name
    was Just Gary???,<br>
    Just Gabe, Trot Twat (formerly Just Sonya {we&#146;ll talk about that naming later}) sorry
    if I forgot anyone.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">So after having a few pints, a quick chalk talk, a
group grope&#133;the hares were off <b>PROMPTLY</b> at 4:00&#133;<br>
well more like 4:45ish.&nbsp; The hashers went back into the bar and emerged about 20
minutes later to start the trail.<br>
Just Gabe and Just Duane led the pack around the bar and they soon began spreading the
sound of on-on<br>
through the streets of Melbourne. Just Shoe was getting honks about his DON&#146;T TREAD
ON ME flag from<br>
the lower income people and the rich snobs were not honking. After a quick jaunt down
Wickham road,<br>
the pack then entered the shiggy. Soon the pack came to the first of many water
&#145;areas.&#146; </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">I.F.H. recollects that the pack stood motion-less
looking for a place to cross so their shoes and socks<br>
would not get wet.&nbsp; Finally, I.F.H. knew who the hares were and realized that water
was a must on a<br>
Yanksit and Without Socks trail so she went through the water slowly cautious of Florida
gators.<br>
Once she went through, the pack realized that I.F.H. went the wrong way, so they then went
on<br>
true trail and I.F.H. followed. Then they came to the construction site,<br>
and by this time everyone was wet.&nbsp; Edgar and Just Jay went to the right and came to
a false trail,<br>
so they returned and told everyone the trail went to the left, but Fire said, &quot;That
can&#146;t be right.&quot;&nbsp; She went<br>
ranging into the woods while Just Duane pulled I.F.H. out of quicksand. Fire found trail
and the pack followed. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial">One quick note&#133;this spot on trail is where
    Without Socks tried to make a water crossing and the water came up to his neck. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">So after a few checks and about 2 miles, the pack
eventually began to say, &quot;Where&#146;s the beer check?&quot;.<br>
But there was no beer check because the hares never put one on trail because they were so
unorganized.<br>
After a trail through the golf course, and a crossing of Wickham road, the pack then began
falling apart.<br>
Short Straw thought he knew a short cut and Delta Dildo and Fire followed him. The others
were smarter<br>
and followed the marks. <b>Short Straw needs to pay attention at the next chalk talk.</b><br>
Edgar and Just Jay were FRBing and went up the stairs at the Imperial Plaza, and no one
followed<br>
because they were lazy and smart. Potty and Puke contemplated getting a steak at
Durango&#146;s and<br>
eventually everyone, except Short Straw, Delta Dildo, and Fire, followed trail back out to
Wickham road.<br>
By this time, the tall guy Just Gary???, had told the same lame joke for the 4<sup>th</sup>
time on trail. </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial">The joke was - A man with 10 kids goes to his doctor,
    and says, &quot;Doctor how do I keep the stork from<br>
    flying over?&quot; The Doctor says, &quot;Shoot it in the air&#133;get it? Shoot IT in the
    air.&quot; That is the cum<br>
    - that was for Slow Poker, because he is a little &#145;slow&#146;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Finally the pack saw the BN and after one last water
crossing they found the hares sitting on the cooler<br>
with the beer. After everyone arrived, and yes everyone means Short Straw, Delta Dildo,
and Fire the circle began.<br>
Kojak first put the hares, Yanksit and Without Socks, on ice and everyone told them the
trail sucked.<br>
Then Yanksit took the circle and we did a toast for America.<br>
Just Richard gave the FRB trophy to Edgar and Erector and Trot Twat were proclaimed the
DFLs.<br>
Trying not to break their hips, Kojak (62) and The other old guy (68), carefully got on
the ice and did a down-down.<br>
The other old guy was drinking wine; he must have grown out of beer. The tall guy, sat on
the ice and Kojak told<br>
a story about some guy named Saliva and Atodd. The Austin wankers did a down-down,<br>
and told some of their stories from Austin. The pack especially loved the one about Fire
and I.F.H.<br>
clogging the toilet because of their laxative sundaes. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">The pack then began protesting calling Just
Sonya&#133; Just Sonya anymore. So Yanksit knew the only thing to do<br>
was have a naming. Hear we must remember that as Just Puke said, &quot;IT&#146;S SAFE TO
SAY&#133;&quot;<br>
many names were shot around. Horse Fingerer, Mrs. Ed, Trigger Frigger, Punky Brewster,<br>
Short Bus Window Licker, but eventually TROT TWAT won. Thank Fire and I.F.H. for that one.<br>
After a 50/50 and a swing low the circle ended and the pack was juiced to go to Salt Water
Jacks to sing kareoke. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">After reading the karaoke rules, the singers were
given a number. After waiting for an hour I.F.H. sang and she was<br>
followed by Fire. Delta Dildo and Without Socks sang and then we all realized that this
place sucked for karaoke.<br>
Just Duane got the waitress&#146;s number and Short Straw got denied by Mickey or was it
Vicki?<br>
Just Richard bought a round of Jagermeister shots, and then everyone made their way to the
cars and anxiously<br>
began looking forward to the next hash. Without Socks, I.F.H., Yanksit, Fire, and Just
Puke did an on-after on-after<br>
and sang some more karaoke at The Poor house lounge. Finally we found a place that you
could sing<br>
more than one song in an hour time span, plus there were no RULES!!!!! This may be a new
hash bar for us. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Hope everyone liked the HASH TRASH. If we forgot some
things or added some not correct things sorry.<br>
F-you I don&#146;t see you typing at the computer on a Sunday morning hung over like us!!!</font></p>
