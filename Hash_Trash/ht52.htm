<br>
HARES:&nbsp; Just Puke and Yanksit.<br>
<br>
Twenty plus idiots braved the Florida highways and Interstates to<br>
venture north to a place called Port St. John.&nbsp; Since most were regular<br>
BVD'ers we had to pass thru customs at the Cocoa area.&nbsp; At least going<br>
thru all those damned lights at SR528 seemed like it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
So we gathered at Patrick's Pub which was a hell of a lot easier to find<br>
with the second group of instructions.&nbsp; Most Hashers outside of Patricks<br>
were complaining about how chilly it was up in the north.&nbsp; It did seem<br>
about 10 degrees chillier up there.<br>
<br>
It took more than the usual amount of time to get organized(?)for chalk<br>
talk cause we had to wait - and wait - and wait for Just Puke to arrive.<br>
Seems he got a bit under the weather at the Friday night Street Fest in<br>
Melbourne.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
So, at about the time that the BBQ behind Patrick's was smellin real,<br>
real good our dear Hares decided to have chalk talk and they were off. <br>
Now folks, I have seen some funny shit on Hashes in my experience, but<br>
this was one for the books.&nbsp; Just Puke took off down US 1 with his bag<br>
of tinted flour bouncing on his rather large butt and it was a sight<br>
from Anthrax heaven.&nbsp; Clouds of blueish smoke were following him and we<br>
were taking bets as to how far he would get before the fuzz got his ass.<br>
Oh well, I guess PSt.J doesn't have a police force and the damned<br>
Sheriff was elsewhere - too bad, that would have been a hoot.<br>
<br>
And so we did a little urban wandering until someone hollered &quot;Beer<br>
Near&quot;.&nbsp; Ah, yes, those magic words.&nbsp; And suddenly your faithful reporter<br>
realized he had been there before - it was Crotch Duster and Cockpit's<br>
place.&nbsp; Very fitting, as Butt Wrangler, possessor of the HUYA for the<br>
past several months, finally returned it.&nbsp; Anyone who was on run #3 (I<br>
think) will recall the night we lined CD &amp; C's garage with blocks of ice<br>
and sat all those nice people from Orlando until one of them finally<br>
admitted stealing our brand new HUYA from run #2 in Cocoa.&nbsp; Thankyou<br>
Crotch and C'pit, your house will never be the same.&nbsp; Photos follow.<br>
<br>
And then we moved on to - guess what - YAYYYY, shiggy.&nbsp; Some damned good<br>
shiggy too.&nbsp; Beer stop #2 was in the shiggy, well, there were a few of<br>
the usual &quot;Cracker&quot; houses nearby with lots of dead vehicles and junk in<br>
the yard.&nbsp; The shiggy was so thick and slow going in spots that the pack<br>
was pretty much together.<br>
<br>
And then we took off for the ON IN.&nbsp; A rather long straight-away (you<br>
expected something else from Yanksit?), and suddenly we were there. <br>
Well, almost.&nbsp; It seems that our usual troop of FRB's got a bit<br>
disoriented or something (Edgar Allen Ho, Potty Flavor and visiting<br>
Daytona RA No Blow (hope that's spelled correctly), just kinda<br>
disappeared.&nbsp; They finally showed up and I believe I heard Ho saying<br>
something about it must be the altitude cause he was f%ckin plumb wore<br>
out.&nbsp; Yeah, that altitude up there will get ya if you're not careful.<br>
<br>
THE CIRCLE:&nbsp; We toasted the usual things but this week was a bit special<br>
as we were celebrating USMC birthday and Veterans Day weekend so all the<br>
vets got a bunch of down downs.&nbsp; Yours truly got a bit more than usual<br>
being the only Jarhead present.&nbsp; There was one Virgin courtesy of Butt<br>
Wrangler who somehow got away with smoking a butt while his butt was on<br>
the ice.&nbsp; Many butts kissed the orange block (left over from Hashoween<br>
cause we were in some upscale bar in IHB and couldn't have ice).&nbsp; The<br>
best was saved for nearly last when Dr. Without Socks (he was wearing<br>
some) and IFH kissed the orangeness and sat there while yours truly read<br>
them the 226th Birthday message from the Commandant of the USMC. <br>
However, they did teach us the proper way to do a Chinese Fire Drill. <br>
If only we all could have such small and cute (IFH) butts. <br>
<br>
Butt Wrangler presented the HUYA to Bike Bitch for all of the beautiful<br>
photos he took at the Hashoween????&nbsp; Bitch says he will have copies for<br>
all soon.<br>
<br>
And what's a circle without a naming?&nbsp; Just Judy, who has now been with<br>
us four or five weekends will forever more be known as - Taa Daa -<br>
BLOODY HO.&nbsp; Welcome Bloody Ho to our crazy, fun lovin group.<br>
<br>
And then we Swung Low and moved onward to the On-After.&nbsp; Well, I think<br>
some people did.&nbsp; I kept seeing folk peel off heading toward the base,<br>
toward Cocoa, toward a pee stop (Fire and Yanksit), that I decided to<br>
hell with it and headed home for a shower and a nice dinner at Matt's.<br>
<br>
Good Run - Great Day, the way it is supposed to be.<br>
<br>
ON ON<br>
