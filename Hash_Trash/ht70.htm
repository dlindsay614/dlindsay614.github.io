faint ticking could be heard as slowly, ever slower, the time passed by. &nbsp;Experience
told them that soon the hounds would come sniffing, each expecting a trail of
shiggy and count backs, of boob and yak checks. &nbsp;A trail they expect, a
trail they will get. &nbsp;The hares vigilant in their planning, cover each
step, each twist, each turn. &nbsp;The doughnuts are ready. &nbsp;The Jello has
gelled.<br>
A FATBOY Hash was about to be had.<br>
<br>
The pack gathered at Pineapple Park in Eau Gallie, FL just north of the Public
Library. &nbsp;Our hares of the day Ass Packet and Suckulater were at the ready.
&nbsp;Sir Flatchulot from Daytona and his bride to be,<br>
Salad Shooter (congrats folks) arrived for the run. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Visitors from far and near appeared: &nbsp;Geezer Pleazer and Ex-Lax in route
from Korea to California were in town visiting family. &nbsp;Just Clint, the
brother of Shooter dropped in and Tuna Helper was here from South FL. &nbsp;Dick
Upon a Star from South Carolina came along with Sperm Burp and Chippendale from
Orlando. &nbsp;Virgins showed too, Just Jason, Just Thomas and Just Jen. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
With the pack gathered and hash cash collected, the hares held a brief chalk
talk before they were On-Out of the park and On-South behind the library along
the Indian River. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The trail went south through old Eau Gallie across Montreal and onto Houston
Street where Sugar Doughnuts lead the pack to the first stop at the bank of the
river and a Beer Near. &nbsp;Jello shots in Red and Blue with that awesome
Parrot Bay Coconut Rum made the hounds start to get that gleam in their eyes (48
shots consumed). &nbsp;More beer and the hares were away back up Houston Street
to the next Beer Near at Rosetter’s Park on the next street over. &nbsp;(No
one should break a sweat on a Fatboy Hash).<br>
<br>
It had been an exhausting 600 yards since the last beer stop when the hares
noticed just Puke hanging off the Fatboy Wagon. &nbsp;Bad Puke! &nbsp;&nbsp;On-On
from Rosetter’s Park to Joe’s Intercoastal and stop number three. &nbsp;Twenty-Six
pints of lager were poured and the hounds were happy. &nbsp;Dr. Joe’s supplied
Strawberry Jello Shots on the house to BVD. &nbsp;(Great folks, great place!)<br>
<br>
On-On to stop number four on the top deck and 20 more pints were poured. &nbsp;Happier
still the hares are singing and swaying. &nbsp;Dick Upon a Star is kissing
strangers, the tavern patrons are wanting to join this mob of cheerful
(joggers?).<br>
<br>
Kojak relates a story of olde when he was GM and the circle was held on this
very top deck. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not today Kojak, this is Fatboy stop number
four and not yet the half-way. &nbsp;&nbsp;Chippendale with glassy eye’s is
singing S-H-I, T-T-Y, chitty, chitty, trail. -Damned foreigners. &nbsp;I think
that’s what he sang. &nbsp;It’s all a blurrrr.<br>
<br>
Just Randy and Just Cindy arrived to join the hash in progress and me thinks
that makes Just Cindy qualify for a naming at her next appearance. &nbsp;Just
Paul recites the story of his S-Wax, Slow Poker post wedding run-in with the
Beachside constables and his cheerfulness at getting JUST a speeding violation,
(instead of the other bad thing). &nbsp;Just Ken from Titusville is twinkling
his eyes at Dick Upon a Star and might just get lucky on trail.<br>
<br>
On-On up Eau Gallie Blvd to the Lazy Dog Saloon for - you guessed it, stop
number five and More Beer, More Beer, More Beer, More Beer.. &nbsp;&nbsp;Edgar
Allen Ho, &nbsp;Slow Poker and Bike Bitch have found great amusement at the
clean lavatory and its very special marital aids dispenser. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Drunk
people find humor in everything). &nbsp;Fortunately, Stumbelina knew the
difference between a French Tickler and a .75 cent Rubber Band Erection Ring
(ouch). &nbsp;This woman could teach a class in love.<br>
<br>
On-On and the hares entered the final phase north on Guava and Highland Avenues
to the Backstreet bar, Stop no. 6. &nbsp;Larry the owner has encouraged the hash
and the ice to be on his privacy fenced patio. &nbsp;No longer did the circle
get set when whistles were heard and a drunken Drinking Club with a Running
Problem stumbled into the Backdoor of &nbsp;Backstreet.<br>
<br>
Kojak and Slow Poker performed the ceremonies of the circle. &nbsp;15 pitchers
were filled and drank. &nbsp;Visitors and who brung ‘em were iced. &nbsp;Out
of towners did down-downs. &nbsp;The HUYA passed from Suckulater to Stumbelina
for her 30+ hour visit to Sharpes and the first hasher to get out of jail with
phone numbers and dates lined up. &nbsp;Songs were sang. &nbsp;Much laughter was
had by all. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
As you know, this was Mr. Ass Packet’s virgin lay of a trail. &nbsp;What a
hell of a trail and a hell of a good time he provided. &nbsp;&nbsp;The circle
was closed and Chippendale lead off with Swing-Low. &nbsp;Thank you to all who
helped with No. 70 and thanks to the visitors, virgins and bars that all
welcomed the hash and cooperated 100% to make it a good time. &nbsp;A fine time
was had by all.<br>
<br>
The next BVD Hash is No. 69 and a weekend camp out at Wickham Park. &nbsp;We
will welcome Yanksit back from his stay in Korea and celebrate the 69th running
of the BVD Kennel. &nbsp;If you have not registered, please take time to do that
SOON. &nbsp;So get your over night bags ready hashers… we are about to have a
blow out at the park July 20th.<br>
