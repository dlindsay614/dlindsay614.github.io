<p>Well, our hares really out-did themselves with this one. First of all, when we pulled
into the Cocoa Beach Pier parking lot, we announced &quot;We&#146;re with the BVD Hash
House Harriers&quot; and parking was free instead of the normal three-dollar fee. This
isn&#146;t the kind of treatment we&#146;re used to when we utter the words &quot;hash
house,&quot; regardless of what follows these two innocent words. Expecting a confused
stare from the parking garCON, instead he waved us through. What exactly did our hares do
to bribe this gentleman? Free beer perhaps. Second thought, I don&#146;t want to know. The
on-before took place at Oh Shucks Bar, an open-air beachy type place. Surprisingly, we had
a bunch of BVD virgins&#133;enough for our very own cherry tree! I don&#146;t think
we&#146;ve had this many virgins since the BVD H3 was ERECTED last January, and
that&#146;s no crock (I just looked a word up in the dictionary and came across
&quot;crock.&quot; I don&#146;t think I&#146;ve ever used this word in a sentence, and
it&#146;s awesome&#133;That&#146;s a crock&#133;see, sounds cool, doesn&#146;t it?)
Anyway, with nine virgins, two out-of-town visitors, and the BVD regulars, 29 in all, we
headed out on trail, starting with a short jaunt on the beach. We made our way back up to
the main street, did some weaving through parking lots, and over a couple of fences with
no major injuries other than a scratch or two and some torn clothes. We were on-in to the
beer stop, a lovely local dive called the Knot House. Red Hot Anal Pepper found a
&quot;thong&quot; on trail. He gave it to Yanksit who &quot;wore&quot; his new thong
(actually a flip flop) protruding from the back of his shorts&#133;cute. We were on-out
again on this &quot;live&quot; hare hash (do they really think we believe that?!). Our
hares led us through a thicket patch, maybe another fence crossing, and we headed back
toward the beach. After about 3 miles of trail, we saw the BEER NEAR and we were on-in to
the Surfside restaurant &amp; bar. Our hares had arranged for a keg on the upper, somewhat
isolated, deck of the Surfside. They didn&#146;t mind our lewd and crude songs, but took
offense to bare butts on ice, stating they could lose their license or something like
that&#133;What a crock! Anyway, we behaved ourselves and kept our pants on as instructed.
The down-downs went something like this: Toasts to the veterans, pussy killers (??), and
Florida voters, Yanksit just because, the hares, virgins&#151;Jeff, Ward, Karen, Mark,
Lucy, Margaret, Rob, Tracy, and Jean, visitors&#151;Prosecutor from New Jersey, and Put
Your Head Between My Legs from DC H3, HUYA (Head up your ass) to Cockpit because she was
grabbing for the dildo, too long between hashes for Snubbed &amp; Crotch Kitten,
Joe&#151;a local who was quite amused with the circle&#151;did a down-down, Just Puke,
Greg Loose Anus and Put Your Head Between My Legs had a down-down competition&#133;we
weren&#146;t sure of the out-cum, so in true Floridian style, we recounted and rechecked
the competition, just because! After the circle, I saw something I can honestly say
I&#146;ve never seen before. Keg tipping. I&#146;d heard of cow tipping, but never keg
tipping&#151;at least that&#146;s what I called it. You take one very drunk hasher as the
tippee, and two or three other very drunk hashers as the tippers. The tippers tip the
tippee in a head down, feet up in the air position. The tippee puts the keg nozzle into
the mouth and drinks until the tippee turns his/her head away from the nozzle. Turd
Burglar and Butt Wrangler were very successful in coaxing hashers to try this new BVD
antic. After the keg died, the group headed out to a couple of on-afters. The fun never
ends with the BVD H3! </font>
