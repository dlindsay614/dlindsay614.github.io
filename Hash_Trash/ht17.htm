BVD HASH HOUSE HARRIERS, HASH #17<br>

A few dark and dreary clouds hanging overhead (HEAD, WHO SAID HEAD) didn&#146;t discourage
this entourage of die-hard BVD H3 hashers! Although hash #17 was designated as the
&quot;Red Hot Hash&quot; in honor of our new Beer Meister, Red Hot Anal Pepper, I&#146;d
like to propose a theme change to the Wet N&#146; Wild Hash! We were pre-warned at the
chalk talk about leaving behind valuables that could be damaged by water. Cum Chum and his
virgin (hare), Edgar Allan Ho, set off in a furry to set the live trail. True to Cum
Chum&#146;s style, the trail they&#146;d chosen led us deep into the palmettos. They
baffled us right away with a count back to keep us off their heels. After a mile or so, we
came upon a deep water-filled dyke. I have to admit, this is the first chest-level water
crossing I&#146;ve experienced! Fortunately, no one reported seeing (or feeling) water
critters. Our petite hasher, I&#146;d Fuck Her, even had to swim across this particular
dyke. After the FIRST water crossing, we were back into the woods. Another two miles or so
through swampy paths, swarms of knats, and another shallow dyke crossing, and we were
on-in to the beer stop. The second half of the trail was just as adventuresome as the
first. More wet off road trails, one last dyke crossing, a mile or so of paths through
palmettos and we were BEER NEAR! After this 5-6 mile hash, the hounds and hares alike were
ready to unwind. We gathered up for the down-down circle, honoring our one and only virgin
hasher, Just Mark or AKA Bob. MoanerBoner, who made Just Mark cum, sat on ice for her good
deed. Hoosier Daddy&#146;s comment was, &quot;God Moaner, you shaved!&quot; Next, our
hares took to the ice. Somehow, accusations started flying and Surf ended up in the circle
for throwing his shoes across the dyke and Moaner did a down-down for stepping in the
circle without being asked. Three new BVDers, Ram It Home, Rug Burn and Screwy Rabbit,
were recognized with down-downs. Fireindahole and Sperm Burp ended up on the ice. Bitch Be
Gone presented the HUYA (Head up your ass) award to Edgar Allan Ho for allowing himself to
be wrapped in toilet paper and thrown into Bitch&#146;s pool during hash #14. Red Hot Anal
Pepper did a down-down for taking over the most important duty as the BVD H3 Beer Meister.
Finally, the 50% rule came into play&#151;over half of those present had down-downs, so
the final few lost souls were brought into the circle for a down-down. Somewhere among all
this, the rain poured on the circle, washing out the chalk where we all stood, but no one
budged. Our very own RA, Yanksit, continued on with his duties without missing a beat.
Yanksit was impressed how everyone stood their ground. He did notice that Pussy Gourmet
and Kojak put on their condom style rain ponchos (they drank, of course). Hoosier Daddy
was spotted sitting in the hashmobile, dodging the rain. She was promptly removed from her
cocoon and she sat upon our lovely block of ice. With the circle closed, we sang, ate,
drank, socialized&#133;basically, we had a damn good time! </font><font size="3"></font>
