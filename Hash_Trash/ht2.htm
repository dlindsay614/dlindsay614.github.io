<p>The second hash for some, and the first BVD Hash for a lot of neighboring hashes saw 35
hounds flock to Coconuts Bar on the beach for the second live hash in the short BVD H3
history. Fireindahole (sub- Hash cash) was frantically signing people in and gladly taking
in cash. Members arrived from the local bike hash, Daytona H3, and Orlando Hashes. A
massive turn out and outstanding weather (thanks to the BVD R.A.) got the pack of hounds
ready for an old fashion hare and the hound chase. After a brief chalk talk from the hares
to the virgins in the crowd, the hares took off. Kojak, the BVD GM, valiantly held off the
pack for the requested time of 15 minutes to enable the hares to get some much-needed
trail laying distance. The trail weaved its way up along the inner island side up to I
Dream of Jeannie Blvd and took the hounds over a fence and through a bird sanctuary and
out on to the beach for some visual stimulation on the awesome winter day. The hounds
cruised there way into Coconuts for some cold beer and great company thanks to Chris,
manager of Coconuts. Down-downs where given to just about everyone with a touch of Europe
&quot;ICE.&quot; The BVD H3 Hash H.U.Y.A. (Head Up Your Ass) Award was given to Kojak to
start off the HUYA&#146;s existance. Kojak set it down it was stolen. Until Kojak locates
the beloved HUYA he must drink. Please help your vigilant R.A. in maintaining a down-down
at all hashes until Kojak brings the HUYA back to the BVD H3 down-down circle.</font>
