<p align="center"><strong>BVD Run #45 Hash Trash.</strong><br>
Weather: Clouds and Rain<br>
Hares: S-Wax, Slow Poker, and impromtu Hare: Cum Chum.</p>

<p align="center">The day started off sunny and clear as the hares (Slow Poker &amp;
S-Wax) started pre-laying the trail about 12:30. The group of about 16 all-weather hashers
and &quot;Fireindahole's&quot; virgin gathered at New England Eatery around 4:00 pm.</p>

<p align="center">Birthday hats were distributed to everyone by S-Wax. We had our group
grope and the flour laden chalk talk commenced. It started to rain, (Short Straw swears he
heard a deep booming voice telling us to build an Ark and collect animals 2 X 2), so the
Songmiester's rendition of Father Abraham was cut short and the pack was On-Out about
4:30.</p>

<p align="center">The trail was basically laid out in three phases broken up with beer
stops, Phase 1 through the Melbourne Shores housing development and ending at Mark's
Landing and a beer stop. Phase 2 from Mark's Landing into the South entrance of a Nature
Trail (This is where late comers, Barely Cums and Just Summer joined the pack). Mid-way on
the Nature Trail, at a little look out area, there was an E.C. (extra credit). It was a
cooler full of tequila shots, complete with salt and fresh limes, that was being minded by
the Tequila-Gator. The trail went on through the Nature Trail and was supposed to have a
turkey/eagle split that would take the more ambitious runners through the wetter part of
the trail. Somehow this part of the trail disappeared before most of the pack got there
(Do tell Yanksit). The Phase 2 trail finished at the North entrance to the Nature Trail
with another beer stop. At this point it was still raining and I, in very un-hash like
fashion, did not want to lay the last &quot;Beach&quot; phase of the trail (I voted for
sending the pack straight back down A1A to the end). The last section of the trail was
supposed to be run across A1A to the beach, through a wide beach access, then down the
beach to a Pizza Restaurant&#146;s beach access, back across A1A and then down to N.E.
Eatery and the end. Cum Chum was the first FRB out of the Nature Trail and said we <i><b>should</b></i>
run the beach, and that he would be happy to lay it. He grabbed the flour and was On-Out.
Most of the pack was stopped prematurely at the Melbourne Shores Private beach access but
eventually made it back to the end, via car and vanpool, and the circle was formed. The
ice had to be moved a few times as the fire ants were not being very gracious about
sharing their space.</p>

<p align="center"><br>
The hares did their Down-Downs. There were hash announcements including information on the
BVD Hash article that has started to appear in the local papers. FRB and DFL trophy's were
giving out to Cum Chum and Just Sonja respectively. Mistress Stumbilina has (temporarily?)
misplaced the DFL trophy and Cum Chum wanted to know how he could be Co-Hare and FRB at
the same time (a BVD first?). There were many accusations put forward including some
reference to a couple of hashers doing their &quot;From here to Eternity&quot; rendition
on the beach&quot;? Without Socks added the Tequila-Gator (Found on trail at the E.C.) to
the HUYA and presented it to Butt Wrangler for being a true hasher, he got in an accident
and wrecked his jeep on the way to the hash but still showed up! We were soon asked to
come into the bar or leave N.E. Eatery, I guess I did not tell them we would have our own
beer (although I am pretty sure I did). I did say we would be singing vulgar songs but I
guess an hour's worth was too much for some patrons as they complained. The RA/GM said a
prayer and dismissed the circle. Oh well! Everybody seemed to have a good time and really
liked the Nature Trail and Beach portions of the run.</p>

<p align="center">Buttt, there are a couple more things....</p>

<p align="center">Sox was iced for having an erection which wouldn't work. Kojak told him
it is because he has not ball(s) and then presented him with a nice shiny big bowling ball
which put his ass a bit more on the ice. Fortunately, Kojak took the ball back otherwise
it would have ended up on the HUYA as well. (Hey Socks, I'll be gone for two weeks. Have
your bowling outing and have fun.)</p>

<p align="center">(s)Tumbalina was iced. First let me explain. The Founders of this Hash
decided from the git go that we would not change anyone&#146;s Hash name except in very
very unusual circumstances. However, that does not mean we cannot add something. So, our
very own dominatrix was iced and newly named Mistress/Madam (your choice) (s)Tumbalina.
(Biko Sykos please note).</p>

<p align="center">Cum Chum informed the group that a collection was being taken to send
Kojak to Thailand - one way. Kojak passed a mug and the only thing put into it was some
suds. (Hey, if y'all are so damned cheap how about pooling some air miles which you don't
have enough of to get your butt to anywhere, and I'll be gone.)</p>

<p align="center">Kojak attempted to teach the group the fine are of ice spinning. &nbsp;
Believe the record at the Pattaya H3 is five complete turns on the ice. &nbsp;
Unfortunately, it appears our block of ice is a bit small, or maybe it was just too slick
from all the rain. Y'all practice this at home and we'll have a contest in the future. <br>
<br>
Finally, this was the second Hash in a row where the rain gods really smiled on us. Should
this nonsense continue Mismanagement may consider changing the name to The Drowned Mutts
H3.</p>
