Irish Eyes are Smilin’ They are Sure to be<br>
knowin’ that BVDH3 is Cummin’ to Hash.<br>
<br>
Green eyes, Green dresses, Green kilts, Green hats, Green skirts,<br>
Green beads, Green shoes, Green hair and one Kelly Green beard;<br>
the hounds began to gather behind the EATZ restaurant on SR 192<br>
New Haven Ave. in Melbourne.<br>
<br>
Virgins? We love virgins. &nbsp;And did we have Virgins! &nbsp;Just Ken, Just<br>
Shawn, Just Heidi, Just Stacy, Just Jill, Just Becky, Just Cory, Just<br>
Shane, Just Margaret, Just Tania, just get out your money and check<br>
in pups, the hash is about to begin.<br>
<br>
At 12:30 prompt, the keg was tapped. &nbsp;The pack arrived slow at first<br>
then stragglers kept cumming in off the street. &nbsp;T’was not but 1:00<br>
when the bus from Casa de’ Bitch arrived and added to the pack this<br>
week’s out-of-town hashers; Sir Flatulot, Gilligan, Watch-Em-Wiggle,<br>
Bag Lady, Brown-Eyed-Monkey-Lips, Four Score, MP2, Way Beyond<br>
and Wet Dream were all sniffed and welcomed to BVD.<br>
<br>
Our hash cash S-Wax performed her mismanagement duty and gathered<br>
that green that makes our bills and fills our glasses.. (so we can drink<br>
and fall and bust our a****). &nbsp;Each hound arrived with candy and
Suck-U-Later<br>
took charge of issuing beads, beads, beads for throwing. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
We lined up in position behind the Fire Engines as the parade began to<br>
get organized. &nbsp;Just Shawn volunteered to be our truck driver and followed<br>
close in by the engines. &nbsp;The lazy dogs piled aboard the truck for an easy<br>
ride down the parade route. &nbsp;Hoosier Daddy and Mullet arrived and fell in<br>
with BVD at the starting point. &nbsp;The BVD banner and flags were waving fine<br>
proud as the bag pipes sounded and first motions of the Meg O’Malley’s<br>
St. Patrick’s Day Parade was ON-ON.<br>
<br>
Now the key to life and power is not money. &nbsp;It is not fast<br>
cars, boats or material possessions. &nbsp;It is not fighter jets or<br>
massive armies. &nbsp;The key to ultimate power over the sum total<br>
of the universe is one thing and one thing only;<br>
<br>
AN ARM FULL OF THROW BEADS!<br>
<br>
Like crack heads they screamed and shouted in torment. &nbsp;Little<br>
old ladies with a kindly smile would yell (fu*k!) if she missed a<br>
strand that was caught by a child in a carriage.<br>
<br>
Grandfathers would rip them from the hands of their grandchildren.<br>
Make no mistake, the power of the bead is a mighty force. &nbsp;More<br>
beads will be needed next year as those of us that prematurely<br>
beadulated had no beads to throw when the crowds were thickest. &nbsp;<br>
Beads and beer, Beer and Beads the parade route we did go.<br>
<br>
ON-ON we went with the crowds cheering. &nbsp;The end of the parade<br>
signified the start of the trail. &nbsp;The keg was now floating which<br>
means in 1.5 miles we had consumed an entire keg o’ the purest<br>
gold lager. &nbsp;In short, the pack a gleeful smile on their faces, roses<br>
in their cheeks and twinkles in their eyes. &nbsp;Just Puke had also<br>
provided a fine extra credit &nbsp;jug o’ yucca for our drinking pleasure.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Our hash flash in stealth Dick Sniffah’ appeared from a side street. &nbsp;<br>
A quick group grope was formed and flashes flashed before the pack<br>
was again ON-ON to the trail. &nbsp;Our hares of the day were Just Puke<br>
and Yanksit. &nbsp;Around and around we would wind until discovery of the<br>
Green House and On-In to Beer Near. &nbsp;Thank &quot;G&quot; for the Beer Near<br>
as it had been at least 45 steps since we finished off the last bit from<br>
our drinking vessels.<br>
<br>
The hash was foggy from this point on and details are sketchy at best. &nbsp;<br>
The Suck-U-Later Secret Pocket Recorder had a single recorded message<br>
the following day. &nbsp;The voice was our own Without Socks and I quote<br>
&quot;Ooo thaz yur recorder thing, lemme leaf a messaj. &nbsp;Um Witout Sox haz<br>
a big dick, yah, tell em that.&quot;<br>
<br>
After or before the next bar, we were at the half way point. &nbsp;It was
outside<br>
and we were drinking those evil, wonderful, evil, wonderful Apple Pie<br>
Shots. &nbsp;ON-ON to somewhere else. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
My black-out period lightened up when we entered Big Al’s. &nbsp;I seem to<br>
remember that Sir Flatulot was under the pool table grabbing at ankles<br>
or trying to get up or dying, again, I am not sure. &nbsp;Wiggles apparently had<br>
sex on top of the pool table with Suck-U-later, although the stickiness<br>
might have been from spilled Apple Pie Shots and not good loving.<br>
<br>
Yanksit our esteemed RA stood on the bar or a stool to make announcements.<br>
This was the 1 year analversary for Salad Shooter, Dick Sniffah’, S-Wax and<br>
Just Dennis. (Just Dennis wore a smart green frock to celebrate). &nbsp;They all<br>
did down-downs. &nbsp;Slow Poker was celebrating his 25th Run and he did a down<br>
down down down down down get out.<br>
<br>
We had a few too long in between hashes: &nbsp;Hoosier, Mullet, Moaner Boner,<br>
Red Hot Anal Pepper, Crusty Cream, Sperm Aid, Just Dennis, Potty Flavor,<br>
Erector Pad and Ass Squealer. Kojak celebrated his 50th BVD run<br>
while Slow Poker drank to his 25th.<br>
<br>
Down Downs being complete and the day’s hash cash exhausted the pack<br>
headed On-Out to Meg’s for Irish Whiskey and Cheer. &nbsp;Hounds went left,<br>
hounds went right and the pack dispersed. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The ON-After returned to the &quot;Little-Gay-Cottage&quot; of our Bike Bitch
for<br>
a naked party in the Orgasmatron.<br>
<br>
No. 69-8 was a hash to remember. &nbsp;We made our Virgin’s laugh and<br>
sing. &nbsp;We made our fabulous pack of hounds drunk and silly. &nbsp;Just<br>
Puke and Yanksit did a super job of Haring this special event. &nbsp;What<br>
I remember was awesome. &nbsp;Thanks to you all. &nbsp;Thanks to those of<br>
you that were too long away and to you Virgins for being brave enough<br>
to last most of the day. &nbsp;We hope to see you all in two weeks.<br>
<br>
Note: &nbsp;Our own Bloody Ho tripped after Meg’s and fell upon her arm.
&nbsp;<br>
It is broken and yet she put off the hospital until after a good Sunday<br>
breakfast with the Hashers to close the weekend out. &nbsp;As you all know:<br>
&quot;You cant keep a good Ho Down&quot;!<br>
<br>
May the Hash Go in Peace<br>

</span></font><font size="3" face="Arial"><b><span style="color: #008040; mso-bidi-font-size: 7.5pt">Here's
a couple of additional thoughts from Watch'emWiggle…<br>
<br>
1. Short Straw, sorry I couldn't shake off my &quot;nap&quot; to come back out<br>
and play when you got there, but thanks for coming in to say hi.<br>
<br>
2. Shooter, Puke and Sir F…you were lovely bed partners and I had a<br>
grand time. Wooooohooooo!!<br>
<br>
3. BB, thanks for the space in the Palatka Presidential suite, complete<br>
with pillow mints. You are the man… You only loose supreme<br>
host points for getting drunk and driving off and leaving my ass<br>
downtown looking for you<br>
<br>
4. Uhhh, I vaguely recall being molested on the pool table.
Upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
sobering up I've got ball shaped bruise on my ass and one on<br>
my back…<br>
So I guess it really happened?<br>
<br>
5. Of all the strange and interesting comments that have been made<br>
about my breasts over the years. Yanksit's comment becomes my<br>
favorite. &quot;In the event of a hot tub emergency, Wiggles' breast will<br>
be used as a floatation device.&quot;<br>
<br>
6. Now while I was &quot;napping&quot; (passed out, whatever) what was Sox<br>
doing dancing around in nothing but my necklace?<br>
<br>
7. Did anyone else notice Sir F underneath the pool table? He swatted<br>
&nbsp;at my ankles and scared the hell out of me, I almost dropped<br>
my beer, that's gotta be a down-down…<br>
<br>
8. Once again IFH, thanks for forgiving me for almost killing you.<br>
<br>
9. And thank you Slow Poker for running interference for us, you made<br>
the rest of us look fairly calm and sober….;)<br>
<br>
10. As many clothes and stuff as were left at The Little Gay Cottage,<br>
I just want to know, how many people just walked to their cars<br>
and drove home naked?</span></b></font></body>
