<p>Whhhaaaattttssss Uuuuupppppp!!!! (How&#146;s that Turd Burglar?) We had an awesome time
at BVD H3&#146;s first Red Dress Hash! I&#146;ve never seen so many sexy BVDers in one
place! Tourists and locals couldn&#146;t help but stare and point, especially when seeing
all our burly, muscle-bound hashers in high heels and dresses. Crackers Pub was the site
for the on-before. It&#146;s a well-known biker bar&#133;perfect for a bunch of crazy,
loud-mouthed cross dressers! One of the pub&#146;s regular clients prepared a huge welcome
sign for us. Before long, we filled the pub with over 40 hashers&#151;a BVD record! A
Space Coast Paper reporter mingled among us, trying to get the full scoop on our twisted
group&#151;compliments of our GM. Our co-hares, Yanksit and Ass Backwards, got a heads
start to lay their live trail. Soon after, the hounds took off after them, weaving their
way through a less than desirable part of Cocoa Village. The trail led us up a busy street
and we were greeted with honks and hoots from passer-bys. The trail made a huge loop
around Cocoa Village. No more than 3 miles and we were BEER NEAR and on-back to Crackers.
The owner of Crackers allowed us to party on the back porch of the pub with our own keg!
Is this heaven? To our surprise, Channel 13 News was located right across the street
(spittin distance) from our porch party . A curious reporter came over and filmed us.
It&#146;s only our 9<sup>th</sup> hash and already we&#146;ve made it in the paper and on
T.V.!!!! Everyone circled up for down-downs. Five BVD virgins were blessed with interhash
condoms. Next, the hares experienced butt&#146;s on ice while they downed their beers.
Yanksit called our best red-dressed hashers to the circle: Ball Breaker, Mullet, Pussy
Galore, Cum Chum and Just Howie. They were rewarded with down-downs. Our FRBs were Just
Tom, Cum Chum and Serf. Red Hot Anal Pepper gave the HUYA to K9 Cum Shot for fuckin up his
knee on trail. We had three namings: Just Scott was named Butt Wrangler, Just Tom is Edgar
Allan Ho, and Just Fiona is Cum Chomper. Yanksit called all the visitors in the circle to
drink (whole shit load of people&#133;too many to name). We sang to the owner of
Cracker&#146;s Pub and one of the bartenders bellowed out a poem about &quot;How
pussy&#146;s were made.&quot; Once the keg was gone, we moved the party inside the bar.
They hooked up karoake (misspelled no doubt, bit I don't give a shit) and before you know
it, we were all singing, dancing, and doing the train around the bar. We discovered that
our very own Da Shit is Da Dance Queen! Some of the hasher die-hards closed down the bar
and crashed at a local motel. On-out until BVD Hash #10!</font>
