<br>
</font></font><font size="3">The pack gathered more or less at the usual time at
The Hideaway Pub on Sarno Road<br>
in Melbourne. I say more or less because The Hideaway lives up to its name and<br>
the cell phones could be heard ringing and the question where the hell is this
place?<br>
Hugs and kisses and a little lube for the tonsils and the chalk talk ensued.</font><p align="center"><font size="3">FOUR
plops? What thehell was that all about?<br>
PLEASE, THREE plops is the universally</font> <font size="3">recognized marking
for ON ON.<br>
There are no rules, however there are</font> <font size="3">globally accepted
guiding principals.<br>
Pay attention HARES to be.</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3">So, we were on out and meandered around both
sides of Sarno until we got<br>
into a bit of shiggy, where a very good check kept us at bay for about 5
minutes.<br>
Finally, someone found trail and shortly after we arrived at the EC where lovely
Jello<br>
&nbsp;shots and some other alcoholic concoction waited.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">I should add right here that these two kinda
old and slow farts did carry some flour.<br>
The plops and markings were an absolute delight compared to some who<br>
carry half a pound of flour for a 10 mile jaunt.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">On trail once again with more meandering around
Sarno and then a</font> <font size="3">crossing between Sarno and<br>
Eau Gallie where our favorite letters were found - BN - at one of those
delightful little beer pool halls bars.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">The pitchers were poured and finally the Hares
were out with 15 minutes on the clock.<br>
Well, time passed, there were still full pitchers and the Belmont Stakes were on
the telly.<br>
All agreed the hell with it and stayed to watch War Emblem.<br>
It appeared that everyone in the place</font> <font size="3">wanted to see the
triple as the cheering was very loud.<br>
But with about</font> <font size="3">three furlongs to go you coulda heard a pin
drop cause the favorite got</font> <font size="3">his<br>
ass trounced and we were outa there.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">&nbsp;More meandering around housing areas
until things started looking familiar.<br>
Oh yeah, wet feet coming</font> <font size="3">up. Lolli and I recognized it
right away.<br>
That nice little dam crossing where Run #3 ended. It was a much warmer time of
year<br>
this time around and of course having our one and only Sucky standing in the
middle handing<br>
out more Jello shots was a unique pleasure. And for once everyone waited until
the pack<br>
&nbsp;had regrouped, well almost, I believe our favorite blond snuck off with
the FRB from Daytona<br>
- probably did a little quickie behind the church (naughty naughty).</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">Out once again for a short run to the Beer Near
- you guessed it - at</font> <font size="3">the Little Gay Cottage.<br>
When your scribe got there a few minutes later there were Hashers sitting with
food plates<br>
in hand and the keg had NOT even been tapped yet. What the hell is BVD cuming
to?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">Your scribe was selected to be GM for the day
and decided to have</font> <font size="3">visiting<br>
GM Sir Flatch share in the duties (has he taken up Brevard residency yet?).<br>
&nbsp;So we both shared GM/RA duties and had a lot of good laughs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I won't bore you with all the details, if you were there you</font> <font size="3">know,
if you weren't, HA.<br>
<br>
But, I absolutely must tell you about</font> <font size="3">birthday boy's
spanking. BB was called in iced and then<br>
instructed to</font> <font size="3">kneel over the ice, pants down while IMM was
invited to apply the 50</font> <font size="3">swats<br>
while Flatch counted them out. Yes, BB's butt turned red but I</font> <font size="3">think
it was more from<br>
embarrassment cause those little pats IMM was</font> <font size="3">applying
sure didn't do it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">And then we swung low in every form imaginable
including Superman - that was a new one!<br>
Chipendale where the heck do you cum up with this stuff?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">And then the birthday party continued on into
the night. I sure hope someone got a photo of what<br>
appeared to be about 15 people sitting on top of each other in the orgasmatron.<br>
You shoulda seen that thing Sunday afternoon - YUCK!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">AND if you are missing any articles of
clothing, or all of your clothing Shooter,<br>
shoes, rings, wallets, etc., etc. just give BB a call.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">BB and Sucky you guys did a hell of job. Well
done.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">On Out<br>
Kojak</font></p>
