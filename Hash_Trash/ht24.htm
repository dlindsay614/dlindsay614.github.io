<p>I have to admit, I had my reservations about &quot;doing&quot; a red dress pub crawl
among all those rough and tough bikers. I wasn&#146;t really concerned for myself. After
all, a harriette in a red dress on main street during bike week, resembling a prostitute,
blends in well with all the biker babes in leather, butt-less chaps and halter tops. No, I
was concerned for our studly harriers. Would they be able to fend off our tattoo,
hog-ridin friends? Would we be mistaken for a gay and lesbian parade, and do I really
care? The key was to stay together, and we did. About 35 of us met in a familiar bar where
we drank down a few cold ones before heading out to the next bar. Thor the Wanker was our
designated Hare for the evening. In true hash style, he would lead us from Hash House to
Hash House. After leaving the first bar, we made our way to main street where we became
the center of attention. Pedestrians gave us high fives, took pictures, and videos of the
crazy people in red dresses making a &quot;mad dash&quot; through the center of town. For
those of you who haven&#146;t made it to Bike Week yet, that&#146;s the moment you live
for. We lapped up a couple more beers before venturing out to the next bar. I believe we
went to a total of six bars. One of the most memorable stops was a bar along one of the
main streets where the locals and visitors cruise up and back. Some of harriettes stood
out front of the bar and greeted the passerby&#146;s with waves and kisses. Tumbalina even
jumped on the back of one of the bikes! She made it back to the bar safely after cruising
past us a couple of times. The trail ended at the &quot;Island Bar&quot; or something like
that. Thor made arrangements for a keg at our last stop, so it was the perfect ending to
an awesome evening. By the way, we had a great showing of BVDers. I counted roughly 15
regulars, or almost half of the group. Wish everyone could have made it, but maybe in
March for the &quot;BIG&quot; Daytona Bike Week! This is a weekend event that you just
can&#146;t miss. For those of you who aren&#146;t aware, our next BVD H3 hash is this
Saturday, Oct 28<sup>th</sup>, at 4:00 P.M., AG Edwards, Beachside of the Melbourne
Causeway, HW 192. It'&#146; a Halloween Hash, so wear your best costume. Hey, it&#146;s
one time of the year that people don&#146;t think we&#146;re odd! See you soon!</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
