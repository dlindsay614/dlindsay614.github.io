Hare: Harry Cheezballz<br>
<br>
Hounds: Kojak, Lollipop, Timmy, Shop Teacher, Snippit, Just Mary, <br>
Just Angel<br>
<br>
Shiggy factor was approximately 80% (razor sharp palmettos, a little <br>
water, burnt forest area, pine forest area sand and a little pavement)<br>
<br>
FRB: Snippit<br>
DFL: Kojak<br>
<br>
It was a short trail, approximately 1.9 miles. Started out with a <br>
little pavement from the Running Zone to the gas station on Wickham. <br>
Shop Teacher in the lead to find the CB3. What do you expect from a <br>
dyslexic haring engineer. Trail was found heading into the burnt out <br>
palmetto fields on the Wickhams west side. Out of the shaggy onto <br>
Parkway, Shop Teacher ripped a 2X4 post out of the ground for a <br>
bridge to cross the small ditch. Check mark across the road,Shop and <br>
Snippit go one way, Just Angel heads west (wrong). Shop splits into <br>
the shiggy, Snippit stays east bound on the road,on true trail. They <br>
meet back at the safe crossing before Wickham.Across Wickham into a <br>
short shiggy portion on the south side of Parkway. Then came the <br>
check that takes the hounds across Parkway to the first check inside <br>
Wickham Park.Trail loops through the west forest of the park then <br>
onto the road into a check, Shop &amp; Snippit could not find trail at <br>
the check. They ended up ranging on the road. Found trail down a <br>
ways and missed a little shiggy. Meanwhile behind them Just Mary and <br>
Angel found true trail where the others lost trail. Took the wrong <br>
turn to catch the CB5. Lollipop,Kojak and Timmy were able to follow <br>
true trail thanks to the Just Angel and Just Mary. Finished behind <br>
the flooring shop on the west side Wickham.<br>
<br>
Good time at circle, on after was at Dong Loggers on Post.<br>
