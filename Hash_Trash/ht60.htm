BVD hash goes on the road for the Famous Bike Week Hash. &nbsp;<br>
Geez, this is going to be so much fun, if this I-95 cop will just get off my
ass, dammit asshole I am just waiting for S-Wax, Poker, Short Straw and Shooter
to catch up. Ah, crap there they go.. now they are ahead of me…This cop is a
prick.</font></b><font face="arial,helvetica" size="4"><br>

Ah it’s the Mayan Hotel, nice enough, not too shabby… BVD is piling in by
the car loads. &nbsp;Group grope in the lobby.. &nbsp;bags tossed in rooms..
off..into Gilligan’s bar. &nbsp;First Pitcher.. All is well, damn a lot of
hashers come to this event.. &nbsp;6 pitchers later.. 47,000 horny hashers in a
bar that is 12x12. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ha ha..ha ha .. Slow Poker is trying to get
Bike Bitch to give Arithmadick head.. just cause he looks lonely.. (Bike Bitch
ponders the thought). &nbsp;Time for my move on I-M-M… &nbsp;&quot;Nice new
shoes In-My-Mouth, (she says something about - they are expensive and she is not
drinking out of them.) &nbsp;&nbsp;Fire and Yanksit call from the cell phone on
the highway.. He is screaming.. &quot;Drive…Drive like the wind…they are
already drunk&quot;…2 pitchers later.. Fire and Yanksit are in the bar..
fricken time warp driving.. or hash experience… 6pm Check In, pick up hash
stuff and get arm banded. Cockpit and Crotchduster are here.. oh there is Just
Puke.. Who the hell is Puke’s date? Susan? &nbsp;She is beautiful..
&nbsp;&nbsp;(6 erections are duly noted)… He sure as hell upgraded dates after
his stay in the pen… Kojak piles in with Garfield from the White House
Hash…. Hey Mullet and Hoosier are here. &nbsp;Gamey Gonads is looking fine
with her new hair cut. &nbsp;Ass Packet and Circle Blow are deeper in a hole
than Puxatawny Phil and wont come out of their room. &nbsp;A lot of screaming
and moaning, &nbsp;I wonder if they are ok? &nbsp;&nbsp;Make a deal with Shooter
to hide me if I get foolish and have sex with a hog.. God I want sex with a hog
or well.. anyone really.. 9pm.. the hash… the trail.. begin.. I think.. it’s
blurry.. Off to Robby’s….Doofus White Boy.. All plaid.. All the time.. Hey
it’s a look. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the alcohol fucking with my head.?. I think
Cockpit’s panties just shocked me.. &nbsp;Her eyes are glazed over.. something
aint right. in that girl’s panties.. it just aint natural… damn Puke’s
date is fine.. let’s kill him and take her… I go for beer, kiss the fat girl
at the bar and wonder how she lost her teeth. &nbsp;Who is this Bike Chick
trying to pick up Fire.. she’s straight chick, I say.. and she is our GM (I
slur it and don’t sound very convincing).. &nbsp;But you know.. it would be
cool to watch.. .. fade to black… or did I pass out.. ..no that’s right.. Medical
Advice: 2am french fries will not stop you from throwing up.<br>

7:30am &nbsp;Eyes open. Am I dead?.. Shooter is awake, is that Doofus on the
floor? &nbsp;What happened, how did I get here…3 hours sleep. Why am I
sleeping with these beer cans? &nbsp;No sex, hashing sucks. 10am &nbsp;breakfast..
no one is cheerful except Kojak and Garfield.. seems they didn’t hit it balls
to the wall like everyone else. Fuck age and wisdom.. 10:30 Holy shit it’s
time for the hotel Bloody Mary room crawl.. &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes you can get 100+
hashers in a hotel room if you offer free alcohol. &nbsp;I will share that in
every room in the crowd of legs and arms and asses.. when I pried myself to the
table of drinks.. White House - Garfield—friend of Kojak.. was already there..
smiling.. cocktail in hand… experience wins again. &nbsp;People cross Europe
in a train faster than the Mayan elevator can get to the sixth floor when you
have to poop. &nbsp;Haberdashers begin their haberdashery.. No I aint GOA’N....it’s
a war zone.. I need more beer… &nbsp;Oriental Princess and that guy from
Alabama that sells all the hash stuff are so proud of their wares, especially
the nice big hash flag. &nbsp;&quot;I sell youu – ate-teen doll-ars. no make
mon-ey, ah-reedy roose mon-ey &nbsp;on tatoos – sell at cost, sell at
cost.&quot; &nbsp;They are GOA’N.<br>
<br>
2pm &nbsp;A sea of the coolest Orange Hash Shirts gather and the pack is On-Out
north on the beach. &nbsp;Our hare &quot;Thor&quot; is well prepared and leaves
plops of white flour every 100 feet. &nbsp;(…No Michael Knight here, different
county, no author-i-tay) &nbsp;The pack of 280+ or so hounds are led to the east
end of main street. &nbsp;Orange shirts, orange mugs and a pooping pig key ring
in tow. &nbsp;The excitement gathers, police block the street and ON-ON the pack
takes to the street bikers hollering, whistles blowing, flags waving. &nbsp;A
truly amazing moment in hashtory. &nbsp;Kindred spirits we, running, whistling
and having a great time being us. &nbsp;On-On across the bridge where for the
second time in BVD hashtory.. lightening struck twice.... Dead Guy On Trail.
&nbsp;DGOT - as the bridge gate clips a non-hasher and sends him to heaven (but
he went the other way). &nbsp;Head, who said head. &nbsp;The pack swung north
across the bridge and came to a beer stop just past the Outlaws Club House.
&nbsp;On-On - Next a long way to a deck bar at a yacht club. &nbsp;Much, much,
much beer had been set up for the hash and we took good advantage of the
abundance. &nbsp;Sir Flatchalot running crowd control broke up the BVD click and
sent us to mingle with strangers. &nbsp;An exciting
Wave-Game-Show-Your-Tits-and-Dicks-Hokey-Pokey ensued. Kiddie Porn does a
hell-of-a-good wave. On-Out we went to our next stop at the Love Bar. &nbsp;Strange
monkey love I am guessing. &nbsp;Never the less more alcohol and laughter.
&nbsp;Salad Shooter lost her duct tape shoes and In-My-Mouth’s new expensive
shoes lost that &quot;new shoe smell&quot; (she puked on ‘em) sshhh that’s a
secret. &nbsp;Rumor had it that Poker and S-Wax were attempting friskiness in
the corners. &nbsp;Must have been the karma of the Love Bar. &nbsp;No love was
to be had when the Oriental Princess’s Hash Flag went missing…
&quot;Some-run take my frag.. dey take my frag.. my frag, my frag..&quot; she
screamed.. &nbsp;&nbsp;Now since this was a gay bar and since we were drinking -
it sounded more like someone was offering up their fag.. so no one paid much
attention…and talked amongst ourselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;On-Out we went over the
bridge and returned to the hotel. &nbsp;A good hash complete with new love
stories, dead guy on trail, bad break ups, monkey love and lost frags.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time for a shower and a night on the town. &nbsp;In biker leathers.
&nbsp;All night partying into the weeeeeee hours.<br>
<br>
<u>Beerlog Sunday &nbsp;03/03/2002</u><br>
Awake 8:30, 9:30, 10:30, 11:00 crawl to beer truck, suck on nozzle like a
snorkel until the pain stops. &nbsp;Yanksit is peddling Goody’s powders pool
side like crack to a $3.00 whore. &nbsp;At 1:00-ish the hash gathered sang a
great &nbsp;&quot;Are we all happy - You bet your ass we are! Doodley doodley..&quot;
&nbsp;and we were on-out to the Adam’s Mark Bierkastel Festhaus for the
hangover hash. &nbsp;A quick halt came to many hashers as the Mayan threatened
towing cars if they were not removed. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
I will offer that at last count, I think 17 BVDH3 hounds were in attendance.
&nbsp;A great showing! &nbsp;Our most humble appreciation goes to the many folks
that worked their asses off to organize and conduct the Daytona Bike Week Hash.
&nbsp;We cannot begin to thank you for all you did to make it a great weekend
and keep everything flowing. &nbsp;On-Out for another year. &nbsp;We hope to see
you all in BVD.<br>

*A disclaimer - All or some or none of this trash may have or have not occurred.
&nbsp;Some of the names may have been changed or embellished entirely. &nbsp;Some
may have been left out unintentionally. &nbsp;Perhaps no one was seen screwing
on a balcony, um.. no that really happened.. &nbsp;AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING ..
these were thoughts from a deranged mind.<br>
Until later. &nbsp;A drink
to &quot;G&quot;.<br>
<br>
May the hash go in Peace.<br>
