<p></font><font face="Arial" size="3">Although this was the third BVD H3 hound gathering,
it was the first BVD Full Moon Hash. A pack of about 18 hounds met at the Eau Gallie High
School in anticipation of this hare-raising experience. With flashlights in hand (for
most), the hounds took off into the woods, through mounds of sand and more woods for a
couple of YBFs (you&#146;ve been fucked/backtracks). The trail eventually led everyone
back to the road for awhile and then on up the railroad tracks. While the FRBs (front
running bastards) headed up the tracks, a couple of the SRBs (slow running bastards, or
bitches in this case) came up on our hare Lollipop who was frantically searching for
something in the dark with her flashlight. It turns out she was trying to find the trail
she had laid during the daylight hours. Needless to say, the SRBs quickly became the FRBs.
The packed weaved through more woods and a housing area and somewhere in there, a few
&quot;real&quot; hashers crossed through a baby dyke. Other &quot;runners&quot; were
afraid to get their feet wet and went around (shame on you). Little did they know that
everyone was destined to be wet&#151;who said wet, I&#146;ll take some of that! After a
mile or so of road hashing, the pack was held up for a &quot;H.H.&quot; (hash hold). The
FRBs held up for awhile but just couldn&#146;t wait to get to the beer, so they took off.
Hoots and hollers rang out into the night when the &quot;beer near&quot; came into sight.
Everyone had to cross a rather large dyke first, but it was well worth it because our
other hare Kojak was patiently waiting with beer in tow. The half keg, donated by
Neutered, was quickly tapped. Soon, the whole pack was there and circled up for the
down-downs. Kojak &quot;surprised&quot; the pack with a lovely ice block for our butts. A
bunch of hashers sat on ice and drank for various reasons&#151;FRB, SRB (Mullet, where the
hell were you anyway?!), Miami football fan, visitors, no flash lights, and probably some
others I can&#146;t remember. After the circle, the thirsty hashers polished off the keg
and headed out for the on-after.</font>
