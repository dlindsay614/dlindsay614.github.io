Wedding Day. &nbsp;May 25, 2002.</b><br>
<br>
The BVD Kennel celebrated the 66th running this week with a HASH Wedding. &nbsp;Two
of our own hounds: Slow Poker and S-Wax (ed.) welcomed the BVDH3,<br>
Space Coast Full Moon Hash, DBH3, OH3, JAX Beach Hash, friends and family to
their home in Melbourne Beach.<br>
<br>
Hashers, friends and family arrived bedecked in hash array fit for a celebration
and full of wedding wishes for the fine couple. &nbsp;Elegant servers with
silver trays fit for royalty ran to provide the finest amounts of champagne,
libation and hors d’oeuvres while the couple greeted their guests. &nbsp;Wait…
Who am I fooling? &nbsp;This is a Hash Group. &nbsp;Best think more of an
episode with the Ozzie Osbournes. &nbsp;After greeting, some beers were tossed
in the yard like bones to the wolves while none other than the bride-to-be
herself collected the hash cash of $11 a pop. (Hey, someone has to pay for this
wedding and collecting the cash is a thing wives do best.)<br>
<br>
After the pack and guests had arrived a quick chalk talk was held. &nbsp;Zam-Bone-Me
and Ass Packet provided our lovely virgins of the day. &nbsp;As this is a
wedding theme and not a regular hash, the trail had been pre-laid and took the
pack north and east to the ocean. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
On-On southward the trail led the pack down the beach to a place where our own
GM Emeritus Kojak waited with a cooler of beer, bottle of champagne and wedding
vows to be read. &nbsp;Slow Poker arrived in tie and tails down the boardwalk
with his best man Short Straw. &nbsp;Music and static rang out of the boom box
signaling the Maid of Honor Moaner Boner’s approach. &nbsp;Seconds later the
lovely barefooted Bride all in white sauntered down the steps to the silver
shore of the Atlantic ocean.<br>
<br>
Kojak read the Hash Wedding Vows and both hashers took turns committing their
troths as long as they both shall hash. &nbsp;For you folks that do not have a
dictionary handy, allow me. &nbsp;Troth is a pledge of one’s betrothal, a
promise to marry, a solemn commitment of fidelity.<br>
So we can put to rest the.. &quot;What the hell is a troth?&quot;<br>
<br>
With a few words and a few promises and the couple were joined in holy
hashtrimony. &nbsp;The groom congratulated and the bride kissed, the hash was
On-On south, east then north to the end back at the home of the happy couple.<br>
<br>
Doritos, Tortilla’s, Cheesy-poofs, Sandwich rings, Ziti’s, Spinach Dip,
Deviled Eggs, Mixed Vegetables, Kelly's Raspberry Cider and Beer signaled the
reception to be in full swing. &nbsp;Hot tub bubbling and swimmers swimming it
was finally time to circle up. &nbsp;Our GM Emeritus made an attempt to get some
control on the crowd then Without Socks stepped in for the duty of the circle.<br>
<br>
Our virgin’s and those that brung ‘em did down-down’s, FRB and current GM
Fireindahole was joined by DFL Muddy from Jax on the ice for more down-downs.
&nbsp;The HUYA was passed from Best Man Short Straw to the new couple for losing
their freedom. &nbsp;Our own Just Ann was named &quot;Moooo&quot; and taught us
all about the Congress of the Cow. &nbsp;No wonder Dr. Anus drives 160 miles
each way to see her! &nbsp;We would too.<br>
<br>
BVD has had some recent new folks join our pack. &nbsp;&quot;Lewis and
Clark&quot; and &quot;Serial Mum&quot; have come from hashing in both Turkey and
England, &nbsp;&quot;Vaginal Reject&quot; has been assigned to Patrick AFB and
this is the second hash for &quot;Just Paul&quot;. &nbsp;Welcome to our new
hounds.<br>
<br>
In closing, this hash was a special event for two of our members of BVDH3.
&nbsp;They both work hard for the hash and try to make people feel welcome and
encourage folks to return. &nbsp;We wish them the best in their lives together
and wish them laughter always. &nbsp;Side note: the &quot;legal wedding&quot;
ceremony took place privately with Sir Flatchulot (Capt. U.S. Army) officiating
prior to the hash.<br>
<br>
Until next time,<b><br>
May the Hash Go in Peace.<br>
