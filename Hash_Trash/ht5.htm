<p></font><font face="Arial" size="3">What does Chinese New Year mean to hashers? Well,
after BVD Hash #5, I can honestly say it stands for drunken orgy. A large group of about
30 hashers gathered behind Winn Dixie. A couple of adventurous souls were dressed up in
Chinese or Year of the Dragon attire. Deep Stick added some extra excitement when she
showed up in a short, sexy little thing with stockings. The weather was a bit chilly
considering this is Florida, so the pack was ready to find trail. The FRBs took off with
great speed and eventually lost the trail, coming in 30 minutes late to the first beer
stop at a local tavern&#151;it was actually a very short distance from the start. For
once, all the SRBs were waiting around for all those fast bastards. Everyone was on-out,
across and down US 1, just a hop, skip and a drunken fall to the next bar. Twenty minutes
later, we were on-out and headed South on US 1 and on-in AGAIN to another beer heaven. We
were pleasantly surprised to find Mullet and Hoosierdaddy waiting there for the pack.
Missing the beginning of the hash, they had stumbled onto the trail and followed it to the
bar as good hashers should. After the third beer stop, everyone was feeling pretty damn
good. Did you ever notice how easy it is to cross a busy highway during a pub-crawl hash?
Cars? What cars? The pack weaved it&#146;s way through a housing development and on-across
the railroad tracks to yet another beer stop from the back of Crotch&#146;s hashmobile.
Just Brian and Just Ted braved it across the tracks in front of a moving
locomotive&#151;what can you say&#133;BEER WAS NEAR!! Finally the pack made their way down
the tracks and off through the woods and into another housing development with a final BN
to Crotch Duster and Cockpit&#146;s love pad. Everyone gathered in the garage for the
circle. Interesting trying to get a bunch of already drunken hashers to sing and drink at
the same time. We made the hares drink, then the virgins, the HUYA (Head Up Your Ass)
award went to your on-sec Fireindahole for her Chinese attire. With the circle over, the
pack polished off the keg and rumor has it that one of our virgins was baring it all by
night&#146;s end&#133;hmmm&#133;future hash harlot? </font>
