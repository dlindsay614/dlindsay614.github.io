<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>And the call goes out: �Hear Ye, Hear Ye,
calling all Hashing Colonists,<br>
Our brother Hasher and favorite Mexican, Short Straw, is leaving the<br>
colonies and returning to the home of our founding fathers, the cold<br>
British Isles. This work assignment will take him away from our warm<br>
little piece of paradise for at least half a decade!</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">We know Short Straw has touched many of you,
and we thank you for not<br>
suing, during the past few years. Please come out and show him off in<br>
true Hasher style, let�s celebrate friends, life, and get piss drunk on</font></b>
<b><font size="3">cheap beer!�</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Being the fabulous hosts (and obviously most
na�ve) S-Wax and Slow Poker</font></b> <b><font size="3">opened their house<br>
and home to this motley crew of bedraggled souls for </font></b><b><font size="3">a
hash/party. Given that there would be copious amounts<br>
of beer, and a guaranteed short trail (after all, Shorty was laying this one
live), in</font></b> <b><font size="3">true hasher-fashion,<br>
the hounds turned out en-masse to get piss drunk,</font></b> <b><font size="3">and,
oh yeah, say Good-Bye to Short Straw.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">The hounds gathered and pre-lubed out by the
pool until chalk talk.</font></b> <b><font size="3">Included in the usual chalk
marks<br>
was a �B-J � check � Ooh Wee! More on </font></b><font size="3"><b>that
later�</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>A quick group-grope and then Hares out! And
while the hares were out making a mess of Melbourne Beach,<br>
the hounds went back inside to sign the going away present � an 8.5x11 of this
group of Post-Office<br>
Mug-Shot- candidates, and the H3SC logo all nicely matted and framed. (All
together now, Awwwwww!).</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Then it�s walkers out, toward Mango Drive,
while the runners tried to shortcut the pack by going<br>
the other way east on Andrews (sneaky non-conformists). Out to Magnolia where we
find<br>
our first which-way. About the time the runners found out that North was NOT the
right way, <br>
along comes the�what�s this?...bike hashers? LMAU and Dildo Stat were
(girl)-scouting the<br>
trail for the walkers � awww, geez, can you sink no </font></b> <b><font size="3">lower?
So, it�s South on Atlantic St.<br>
and then we find trail going </font></b><font size="3"><b>toward the East,
through a neighborhood of these <br>
Humungous houses (No Shorty, Northrop is not paying you THAT much!)<br>
and on to the Avenue B beach access where we find the B-J check.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Just as Kitty is beginning to drool with
rabid anticipation over the</font></b> <b><font size="3">possibilities,<br>
he is sorely disappointed to find it�s just Beer and </font></b><font size="3"><b>Jello-shots.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">To our great enjoyment there are signs that
warn, �No alcoholic beverages on the walkway�.<br>
Of course, this is all the invitation a </font></b><font size="3"><b>hasher
needs, and we find the crowd enjoying<br>
the beach view and a beer.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Take a good look Short Straw, it�s going
to be a right smart spell before you see it again!</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>After enjoying jello-shots and beer, the
hares were off again. This time going south on the beach.<br>
Shorty, goes up the public access at Avenue A, and Dr. Anus continues down the
beach.<br>
As we find out later Dr. A laid down a CB to CB that nobody followed (slackers).<br>
Walkers out � oh wait, make that Bike-hashers out (to scout trail for the
walkers � sheesh!),<br>
Auto-hashers out (Good God People! This is a hash, not the geriatric tour!)
Runners out.<br>
Back up to A1A and Ocean Avenue, and then a Turkey-Eagle back to the start.<br>
(Was it a surprise to anyone this was an A-2-A trail?)</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Circle UP! Hares on Ice! New Rule of the Day
� �When anyone drinks, Short Straw drinks�.<br>
Nice going, Doc � ever heard of �When one hare drinks, ALL hares drink�? (dumbass)<br>
This leads to �When one GM drinks, ALL GMs drink� � which pulls in Crotch
Duster,<br>
and now we have a tipsy trio of tanked twits.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">FRB�s to the B-J stop � HarryCheezeBalls
and Buckinghand Phallus (BHP);</font></b> <b><font size="3">FRB end � Just
Puke<br>
(only because Shop Teacher wasn�t here�)</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>All the usual accusations, and the circle
ended with Swing-Low Man-Style � May the Hash Go in Peace!<br>
Recorridos Seguros Senor Short Straw!</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>On-out GoldieLicks</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Heard on trail:<br>
Buckinghand Phallus (10ft into the Eagle trail): �LMAU, give me your bi-cycle�.<br>
LMAU: �No Way! Unless I can ride�<br>
<br>
Crotch Duster: �Sniffah cannot drive a stick shift!�<br>
</b></font><font size="3"><b>Sniffah: Grrrrrinnnnd!</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Other Stuff that you missed if you weren�t
at the party:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3">1. During circle the beer cooler fell over -
although Dildo-Stat was</font></b> <b><font size="3">standing next to it�hmmm,
looks suspicious.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>2. LMAU gave Shorty a �book� of hash
memories with pictures and hash trash. <br>
If you left early, or got too drunk, ya missed it! It's TOTALLY beautiful!</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>3. Dildo-Stat! broke her foot and ankle
pushing the Brit into the pool.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>4. Too-sexy-for-sex talking away to a passed
out Shorty. When Goldie observes this to <br>
him Too-Sexy says, &quot;That's ok, I'm used to talking to people and they don't
respond.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>LMAU�s comments:</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Too many scrotums on ice today (ewwwwwww).<br>
Shorty wore as much beer as he drank (almost).<br>
Bike hashing is the best!<br>
Circle was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay long.<br>
Warm jello shots are NASTY.<br>
Cold beer is GOOOOOD.<br>
Having to drink Kelly's at the end of the night is NOT! (j/k)<br>
CP showed her tits (DUH!!!)<br>
Boys are funny in their panties in the pool (hehe).<br>
Some boys are funny nekkid in the pool!<br>
Puke doesn't make as big a splash as you'd think (LYMI).<br>
Kitty can be in pain and still have fun.<br>
BHP tries to be a good boy and SUCCEEDS (hehe) (the answer to that is NO).</b></font></p>
