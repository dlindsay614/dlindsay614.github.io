Full Moon<br>
August 12, 2003</b></font><p align="center"><b><font size="4">What an absolutely
AWESOME evening.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The pack was out around 7:30 PM from the riverside of Ocean Ave. in Mel Beach.&nbsp;
We meandered through the neighborhoods with all those nice big expensive houses
(our visitors from the UK were impressed), through the school sportsgrounds,
then some shiggy and across the road to the beach.&nbsp; A relatively short
trail enjoyed by all, but the best was yet to come.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Full Moon had not yet arrived so we circled up and had some fun.&nbsp; A few
Kojak stories to get everyone in a playful mood, especially the blondies, and
then the usual down downs for sinners, visitors, FRBs, 50% rule etc.&nbsp; And
then we swung low while watching the beautiful display of phosphorescent waves
in a vivid blue color breaking on the beach.&nbsp; WOW.<br>
<br>
Then Hoosier Daddy broke out the pulled pork , buns and fixins to kinda top off
our liquid bellies, mmmmmm good.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But, wait, the best is yet to come.&nbsp; Finally, old Full Moon started to make
its appearance by painting the cloud stack behind which it was hiding a nice
vivid pink.&nbsp; And then it appeared in all its majesty.&nbsp; And, the
weather was pleasantly cool to beat.&nbsp; This is Florida in August?&nbsp; Even
long time Floridians were thoroughly impressed.&nbsp; How can you beat being on
a gorgeous deserted beach, very few bugs, comfortably cool, the full moon bright
in the sky, Mars a bit below at about 8:00 o'clock, and those AWESOME blue waves
breaking in the surf?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And a great bunch of Hashers to boot.&nbsp; Doesn't get any better than this.<br>
<br>
In fact, when some of us (well, me anyway) decided it was time for bed we
couldn't get anyone to leave.&nbsp; Some of the Harriettes even stayed with some
of the left-over beer while the rest got a ride to our vehicles.&nbsp; Maybe I
should drive down there, they may still be there.<br>
<br>
Thank you Hoosier, Mullet and everyone else for an absolutely PERFECT evening.<br>
<br>
And for those who missed it, you missed it.<br>
