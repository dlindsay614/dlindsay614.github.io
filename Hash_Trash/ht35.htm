&nbsp; Hash Number 35<br>
March 17, 2001 - St. Patrick's Day<br>
Hares: Hoosier Daddy and Moaner Boner<br>
Theme: Green Dress Pub Crawl<br>
Weather: 69 + 16 Degrees: Sunny, cloudy, a drop of<br>
rain, then sunny again.<br>
<br>
To make sure the BVD Hash House Harriers celebrated St. Patrick's - who I really think is
the patron Saint of Hashers - Day right, the hares for this event had a whole day of fun
and frivolity planned. It all started with the downtown Melbourne St. Paddy's Day Parade.
We had the truck, we had the banner, we had a multitude of hashers in green dress and we
had the one thing that made us the most popular group in the parade - BEER! And this
turned out to be a very good thing indeed as the parade was about an hour late getting
started. And it made us a hit with the Shriners, the bag pipers and Meg O'Malley's Grand
Poo Bah who left Meg's float to walk with us. Finally the parade was underway with the
whistle-blowing, beer-drinking, bead-throwing BVD Hash House Harriers walking with style!
The greatest part was the way the crowd watching the parade would holler and cheer when
the &quot;drinking club with a running problem&quot; went by. <br>
<br>
The parade ended at the east end of downtown and after consuming a few more beers for the
two block walk, the group gathered back up at Meg O'Malleys<br>
for the start of the pub crawl. Hoosier Daddy and Moaner Boner gave a very brief chalk
talk and told the pack to look for shamrocks and a JS (Jig Stop) and then they were off to
lay the trail. Yes, you read that right; Moaner and Hoosier actually did a combination
live and pre laid trail. From Meg's the trail went up US1 to the traditional St. Paddy's
Day stop at the Brewery. (A lesson was learned by the hares on this leg..if you are
driving a truck with a banner above it, do NOT go 45 MPH down US1 and expect the banner to
survive!) There they continued to drink the keg and sample some of the other products of
Indian River. From there the pack was told to check back to the last shamrock which was in
front of the old College Campus Café. As easy as those instructions were, and as easy as
the trail was, we still managed to loose a few hashers. Dumb-asses! Although the College
Campus has been closed for some time, Hoosier and Moaner set up the front porch like a
pub, complete with pretzels, beer and shots. While here, the keg began to float so we were
on out rather quickly to the next stop - Green House Bar. As soon as the pack of 32
consumed 45 domestic bottles of beer, they were off again through downtown to the
high-class joint of Big Al's. If you were there, you know I am being incredibly sarcastic.
Big Al's is a hasher bar! Cheap beer, pool tables, juke box and the smell of sweat,
cigarettes and stale beer. The pack drank lots of cheap beer, sang some tunes, and
harassed the upscale patrons then were off to the next and final stop of That's It Antique
Bar. In the back parking lot (where Mullet previously learned Melbourne's Finest frown on
public urination) the pack got their &quot;yards&quot; of beer and circled up. <br>
<br>
As I try to recount the events of the circle, please bear with me.I had been drinking beer
since 11:30 in the morning! First in the circle were the hares and it was decided the
trail was good (like there'd be any doubt). Next were there virgins and there were a lot
of those! Tara, Dennis, Julie, Kathleen, Eileen, Lynda, and maybe a few more I can't
recall. After their down-downs (and a few other things too) Mullet gave the HUYA to
Fireindahole just because he wanted to. By this time, the circle had really gotten out of
control, the cops were looking at us strangely and everyone was pretty far-gone so we
closed the circle with Swing Low. Then everyone was on their own to enjoy more drinking
and fun in downtown Melbourne.<br>
<br>
That's it for this week!<br>
