BVD HASH HOUSE HARRIERS, HASH #47<br>
</font><font face="Arial">Hare: Just Puke<br>
Location: Poolies Biliards Palm Bay<br>
Date: 01 Sept 01 // Hare &amp; Hounds: ??<br>
Weather: 69F + 16F<br>
<br>
The pack met at Poolies for the start of Saturdays hash. We had 4 or 5 virgins show up.<br>
Just Judi, Just Richard, Just Jim, Just ????<br>
Potty Flavor, Gym-Nasty, &amp; Short Straw were at Poolies but opted not to hash for
different<br>
<em><font color="#FF0000"><strong>lame ass excuses</strong>.</font></em><br>
.Saturdays hash was a very short one, 2 miles?? (or so it seemed).<br>
The trail was pre-laid and after the chalk talk the pack was On-Out.<br>
From Poolies we ran back through an apartment complex and then it was<br>
into the shiggy, out of the shiggy, and across Palm Bay Rd.<br>
We proceeded to trek through a little more shiggy (by Puke's standards anyway)<br>
and emerged behind a shopping center just in time to find a special &quot;star<br>
check&quot; where the pack gladly did shots of Jim Beam.<br>
From the &quot;Star Check&quot; is was On-Out and On-Into the first EC at Tapps where<br>
Virgin Just Richard picked up the tab for everyone!! <br>
(Tapps: Nice Bar, lots of different brews).<br>
From Tapps it was On-Out and shortly On-Into our second EC at Beef O'Grady's<br>
where Just Shoe was good enought to pick up the tab.<br>
(This is starting to sound like a pub crawl but you have got to love J.R. &amp; J.S.).<br>
At this point Just Richard could not contain himself any longer<br>
and he had to give thanks for finding BVD by bowing to the hounds and giving praise.<br>
(You just can't make this stuff up).<br>
From Beef's we were On-Out and then On-On a short distance to the end<br>
and the circle behind an abandoned drive thru next to the Poolies strip mall.<br>
Just Puke decided to be the acting R/A and did a great job of taking<br>
care of business and closing the circle.<br>
It was short but fun, and everyone had a good time.<br>

<p><font face="Arial">Gather round you fellow hasing wankers it&#146;s story-telling time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As some of you may know there was a F.Y. Non- Austin Hash this past
Saturday. I your humble scribe, Short Straw, was able to attend the pre-lubing and the
very late On-After (2<sup>nd</sup> location). I could not hash do to prior plans to go do
something. &quot; That&#146;s so gay&quot;, I was kindly informed by a fellow hasher,
Shoot Her or Salad Shooter (who will hence forth be called by her Non-Austin hash name
&quot;<b>DANCES WITH SKANK&quot; </b>for the telling of this tale).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At the pre-lube virgins galore seemed to be the theme. I believe
they outnumbered the wankers. Many a frosty brew was enjoyed. As I made my way to the Bar
Wench (tender) and ordered another copious amount of ale, all the hashing wankers went out
to start the chalk talk. Woe was I all this ale and only myself there to consume, Oh well
I made do. I went out and caught the tale end of the chalk talk and saw many a
confused/amused faces about HASH MARKS. A few pictures were taken to show our fellow
brethren just exactly how we felt about them being in Austin. You were dearly missed
(yeah, right). After they departed on trail I reentered the fine Tavern (Poolies) and sat
quietly consuming my ale (the bar wench was well endowed (of good spirit that is). At the
appointed hour I went to my before mentioned &quot;Gay event&quot;. After completing my
obligations (@9:30) I returned to Casa Carlos were in route it seemed that the local
constables might be performing a sobriety check. I was fully prepared to take such test
but it so happened that I noticed the back road to my humble house and decided to
shortcut. The BMW does great 4 wheeling. Upon reaching the mansion, proceeded to call
fellow wankers as to where on going festivities might be happening. I reached Hashers
extraordinaire &quot;Slow Poker and Snatch Wax&quot;; they were south of us preparing for
an early morning dive, after they had made it half way to their destination only to be
beckoned back by &quot;<b>DANCES WITH SKANK&quot;</b>. Missing keys were again the issue.
If memory serves me right this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> time keys have been suspect with this
individual. Back to the story. S.P and S.W. did not know were the festivities had moved
to.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Ok after that brief intro let the meat of the tale begin:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I promptly called &quot;<b>DANCES WITH SKANK&quot;</b>, amazingly I
actually reached her on the magic talking box called a cell. With dogs barking and
bouncing all around her she informed me (slight slurring) that the On-After-After was at
the magnificent &quot;Purple Porpoise&quot;. I informed/warned that that was perfect,
since I could stroll there. I said my farewells and proceeded to PP. Upon entering I
searched hi and low for fellow wankers. I should have just listened for the loudest group.
In the back were, if memory serves me correctly, Edgar Allen HO and nephew (virgin) or as
they will be referred to as stated by a bar wench &quot;Drunk Bastard and Leave Me
Alone&quot;, the fair maiden &quot;Dick Sniffer&quot; (Enabler) (burn the white overall
shorts, nuff said) Just Richard and Just Julie (??). More drinking ensued and then &quot;<b>DANCES
WITH SKANK&quot;</b> makes her appearance known. After watching some collegiate athletics
on the television. The management cleared some tables and a dance floor appeared.
It&#146;s about to get good. A D.J. started weaving his magic on the crowd and got a fine
young brunette maiden (<b>SKANK) </b>to start gyrating on stage. The Skank was wearing a
long black dress, slit to the waist, plunging neckline and some small shorts underneath
for modesty. Oh and lets not forget the black leather boots. Moves that I had never seen
without the assistance of a Brass pole were performed. The masses were greatly amused and
astonished. This went on for @ 30 minutes. Have I mentioned that copious amounts of the
finest Ale was being drunk. I have now. At this &quot;DANCES WITH SKANK&quot; and
&quot;Enabler&quot; meet on the dance floor and start dancing with some flirtatious
grinding against each other. Drunk Bastard and Just Richard join them, have they not heard
white men can&#146;t dance. <b>&quot;DANCES WITH SKANK&quot; </b>did her best to instruct
them in the fine art of dancing (she was a dance major after all). I especially enjoyed
the IN-OUT motion. Alas it did not take very well with these 2 jesters. A brief interlude
for more beverages and some food. Stuffed Clams for &quot;Enabler&quot; the wings of a
fine fowl (more on these in a minute) for Just Richard and the side of a ground cow
between bread for &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;. The food was consumed and dancing returned
with <b>SKANK </b>holding court center stage. I, your humble scribe, suggested that
&quot;DANCES WITH SKANK&quot; go join her. Initially I was told to go do an impossible act
(at least by me it&#146;s impossible being called Short Straw). Then with the minor
prodding &quot;<b>DANCES WITH SKANK&quot; </b>WAS PULLED OUT OF THE CROWD BY &quot;<b>SKANK</b>&quot;.
Not much resistance I dare say. There was much applause and good cheer. Bodies were
rubbing against each other going up and down, side to say front to back. Hands were moving
quicker than the eye could keep track of. This went on for a while when
&quot;Enabler&quot; also joined the fun and more of the same was done. &quot;Leave me
alone&quot; tried to entice &quot;<b>SKANK</b>&quot; to a solo show with him where he was
told to &quot;LEAVE ME ALONE&quot;. <b>SKANK </b>went back to <b>&quot;DANCES WITH
SKANK&quot;</b> and proceed to gyrate all around her then while lying on the floor used
&quot;<b>DANCES WITH SKANK&quot;</b> as a human LIMBO STICK. I&#146;m told the important
parts were covered or I would have tried to Limbo myself. Needless to say I slept good
that night with wonderful dreams dancing in my head. As the bewitching hour had come and
gone the festivities were coming to an end. <b>SKANK </b>danced with others (did Dances
with Skank Feel jilted?) and was instructed to tone her act down a little. Much rejoicing
was done at our corner but no monetary reward was doled out for the &quot;SHOW&quot; as it
was stipulated the bare skin was req&#146;d. And as we all know &quot;<b>DANCES WITH SKANK</b>&quot;
don&#146;t sit on no ice bare assed much less do a hash flash in a bar. Other minor
players were involved &quot;Mistress Stumbelina&quot; and friend participated briefly (she
has her own tale to tell, with enough encouragement). DRUNK BASTARD AND Bar Wench had an
on going cordial exchange all night long (YO bitch how about more beer, F.U. Bastard) it
seems they knew each other. Some how during all the festivities one of the wings of fine
fowl made it into &quot;<b>DANCES WITH SKANK&quot;</b>&#146;s purse and I am told to this
day it still smells of ginger spice. I take full responsibility for this heinous act, as I
have no other choice. <b>&quot;DANCES WITH SKANK&quot; was</b> to walk home after the
copious amounts of ale she consumed but her rational won out that she lived so close so
who&#146;d it hurt. As visions of Bad Puke danced thru her head she evaded all constables
and safely made it home to Mommy. I proceed to walk back to Casa Carlos. When lo and
behold &quot;<b>SKANK</b>&quot; is crossing A1A behind me to get to her car when a passing
car goes by and yells something. She promptly gets in the middle of the street and starts
to yell, &quot;Y&#146;all want some of this? Well get your punk assess back here
then&quot;. The car was not seen again. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I hope you wankers enjoyed this tale</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Your humble Scribe</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Short Straw</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">P.S. This is entirely from my viewpoint as close to the truth as I
could be any exaggerations, embellishments or out right lies are purely intentional for
the betterment of the tale.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now go forth and do good.</font></p>
