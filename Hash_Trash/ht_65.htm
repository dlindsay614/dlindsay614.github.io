August 21st, 2005</b></font>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Ooh wee it's a Hash day I wonder what Puke
has in store for us.<br>
Oh wait he added Dr. Anus as co-hare (uh oh, Space Coast hasn't had a death
march in a while)</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Oh wait, Puke (Arsehole) has bailed and left
Dr. Anus (husband) hanging.</font></b> <b><font size="3">Kitty to the rescue.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Ok got that all cleared up. Now where were
we?</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Oh yeah Penny Annies (Dive bar
extraordinaire)</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">It's a gorgeous sunny day in West Melbourne
and we enter a smoke filled bar @4:15 to see our hares Dr. A and Kitty (no last
minute change) at a table with the ever prompt Shop Teacher drinking a pitcher
of Annie's finest (no S.T. was not drinking). So Goldie and myself pull up some
chairs and join them. Hmm anybody else going to show up?<br>
<br>
Tick - tock,</font></b> <b><font size="3">tick-tock 4:25 LMAU stumbles in from
the bright outdoors to the dark</font></b> <b><font size="3">&gt;dank cave-like
dwelling. Joins us and asks &quot;where the hell are the</font></b> <font size="3"><b>&gt;walkers?
I need company.&quot; Well if no one else shows up &quot;run cancelled</b></font>
<b><font size="3">due to (fill in the blank)&quot;.<br>
<br>
Tick-tock, hash cash being handed back to hounds, tick-tock, tick-tock. Door
opens again and like Jesus lit from</font></b> <b><font size="3">behind in
enters Harry Cheezeballz in radiant splendor. Ooh wee we have</font></b><font size="3"><b>
5 and thus can Hash.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">So the roster is Hares: Just Puke, Dr. Anus
and Kittylingus, <br>
Hounds:</font></b> <font size="3"><b>Shop Teacher, Goldie Licks, Short Straw,
Lite My Ass Up, Harry</b></font> <font size="3"><b>Cheeseballs.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Ok it's 4:40 hares away. No chalk talk no
nothing.<br>
Everyone knows std</font></b> <b><font size="3">symbols (uh some of do drink and
forget stuff bastards).<br>
After</font></b><b><font size="3"> acceptable time as passed we go out LMAU
spend another 20 minutes</font></b> <b><font size="3">putting on shoes<br>
(no freakin' flip flops damn it!!!).<br>
<br>
We get a group</font></b><b><font size="3"> grope or 2 and spot our 1st True
Trail right outside the door.</font></b> <b><font size="3">Another one on the
road going North. Uh wait this seems familiar. So</font></b><font size="3"><b>
Shop takes off like a rabbit (isn't he a hound) north with Harry meandering in
the same direction while Shorty (crosses Minton and heads north). Shop is now a
speck when Shorty spots an X on the sidewalk, so there must be a count back
somewhere. Oh look, Shop is becoming a bigger speck heading towards us. Shorty
heads out in to the field looking for trail. He wanders East, he wanders
Southeast, he wanders South. NOTHING. Damn Mexican couldn't find his Arse with
both hands. OK must be a YBF or something so back over to the other side and
ranging and looking. NOTHING. Shop is finally back with us (the gals are now
ranging also).</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Shop crosses the Minton and wanders off into
the field then everyone else spreads out (more or less) looking in the field.
Finally a whistle </font></b><font size="3"><b>is blown after TP is spotted
blowing in the bushes along a fence. Ok Shop takes off, Harry not far behind,
Goldie is bounding thru the fields, with LMAU tiptoeing like there's Cow patties
laying around and Shorty is bringing up the rear. Well after much bush beating
we finally get on a road with Shop and Harry off in the distance.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Hmm area looks pretty familiar. Oh wait.
I've laid a freakin' trail all thru this area. Isn't that copyright
infringement? Ok intersection, Shop goes straight into the woods, Harry goes
right, Shorty goes left. Shorty is On-On and blowing away. Hmmm trail goes right
(memory serves me correctly that only water is in that direction</font></b> <b><font size="3">so
ranging ensues while Harry goes to water front and see's true trail </font></b><b><font size="3">arrow
pointing to other shore of lake (damn plagiarist, can they not think of any
thing original, hell this may still be my original true trail mark). Obviously
no one was jumping in (certainly not Shop) so</font></b> <b><font size="3">Shop
and Harry go North while Shorty heads south while the girls decide</font></b><font size="3"><b>
which way to go. Smartly they decide this Shorty guy may know a thing or 2 about
this trail and head after him. So walking around the lake another true trail
into the woods and then loop up on a canal. Shorty blowing away to let others
know not to bother with the B.S. Loop and </b></font><b><font size="3">just come
straight on over the hill. Out on an other road. Shop goes</font></b> <b><font size="3">right
Shorty goes straight and Harry must be watering plants so he is no</font></b> <b><font size="3">longer
behind us. Shop is on and the rest of us head towards him. Yet</font></b> <b><font size="3">another
freakin intersection and Shop goes straight. But Shorty with</font></b> <b><font size="3">the
inside knowledge of running his freaking trail as a hound this time</font></b> <b><font size="3">knows
to go right and Bingo ON-ON. OOH wee FRB. If only Shop had known</font></b> <b><font size="3">that
the street he was on would have brought him right on trail instead</font></b> <b><font size="3">he
backtracked to the pack. Basketball court with a Pit Bull guarding</font></b> <b><font size="3">it
and a true trail arrow going right thru it. OK time to see if pit</font></b> <b><font size="3">bulls
like seasoned Mexican Hashers. Hmm must not be to his taste as he</font></b> <b><font size="3">only
wagged his tail and wanted to play and get petted. That is until</font></b> <b><font size="3">white
people showed up and he took off. Ooh wee Bcheck. The pack pours</font></b> <b><font size="3">in
and LMAU collapses around a beer can whimpering &quot;she wants her mommy&quot;</font></b><b><font size="3">.
Goldie does her best mommy impersonation and rubs her down and rubs</font></b> <b><font size="3">her
with water bottles<br>
(ya had to be there to believe it).</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">What is it with LMAU and technology on
trail? Well again she's on the</font></b> <font size="3"><b>phone chit chatting
away (at least this time she's not standing on a</b></font> <b><font size="3">check
and asking where trail is). So just who is she talking to? Well</font></b> <font size="3"><b>none
other than the original hare, that arsehole Just Puke. So</b></font> <b><font size="3">directions
are given and he shows up right after the hares take off.</font></b> <font size="3"><b>Obviously
fishing and drinking in a new boat rate higher than haring.</b></font> <b><font size="3">So
is he going to do the 2nd half? Hell no, he's in flip-flops and sun</font></b> <b><font size="3">burnt.
LMAU bails on the 2nd half still wanting her mommy and opting</font></b> <b><font size="3">for
auto-hashing. Hmmm that'll never be brought up in circle. Ok much</font></b> <b><font size="3">meandering
thru woods with Shop really wanting to do the tru trail that</font></b> <b><font size="3">Shorty
had him shortcut earlier. No trail went the other way and zig</font></b> <b><font size="3">zag
thru woods and out on streets. Hmmm no apparent marks anywhere so</font></b> <b><font size="3">ranging
ensued until Shorty and Goldie found marks and blew. The other</font></b> <b><font size="3">2
wankers decide to head down the outer st. hoping for a cut in</font></b> <b><font size="3">eventually.
Lucky bastards. Trail actually went out to the main road</font></b> <b><font size="3">about
1/2 way down the street. We cross a nice park not seeing any</font></b> <b><font size="3">trail
but hoping Shop and Harry are indeed on. Plop plop we are on.</font></b> <b><font size="3">Harry
still marking intersections even though everyone is within</font></b> <b><font size="3">eyesight
and can plainly see where he's going. Good Hounding techniques</font></b> <b><font size="3">are
hard to break. We get to a tru trail mark with &quot;To Light&quot; under</font></b>
<b><font size="3">neath it. Simple enough. Well somebody tell the freakin' hare
if you</font></b> <b><font size="3">are that explicit, you don't need to keep
dropping plops.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Ok we are now back on familiar territory
(Minton just south of Penny's).</font></b> <b><font size="3">Can anyone tell me
where you'd think circle would be held. Anyone?</font></b> <b><font size="3">Anyone?
Bueller, Bueller? Yep the field next to the ditch. Ooh wee</font></b> <b><font size="3">BN.
Harry is sucking down a beer, Shop is looking like he wants to</font></b> <b><font size="3">start
drinking, Kitty is topless and looking like he was rode hard and</font></b> <b><font size="3">put
up wet. LMAU and Puke are looking fresh as daisies (ARSEs). Goldie</font></b> <b><font size="3">shows
up glistening. Glistening my ass that woman was sweating like a</font></b> <b><font size="3">stuck
pig. It was hot running in to the sun on the pavement. Dr. Anus</font></b> <b><font size="3">was
..... nowhere. Apparently the hares don't speak the same language</font></b> <b><font size="3">and
Anus didn't realize Kitty was already drinking his share. So Anus</font></b> <b><font size="3">takes
off looking for him only to show up 15 minutes l8r scratching his</font></b> <b><font size="3">head.
Can you say DFL?</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Ok Accusations were made
(excessive/unnecessary use of concrete); lies</font></b> <b><font size="3">were
told;<br>
stories embellished; drinking was done (not by shop who</font></b> <b><font size="3">doesn't
like the taste of Zephyr hills).<br>
Breasticles were sore. Sweaty</font></b> <b><font size="3">shirts were
discarded. <br>
FRBs, DFLs, Auto-hashers, Tech users, Hares and</font></b> <b><font size="3">Mexicans
were made to sit on ICE (block that is).<br>
LMAU needs to be</font></b> <b><font size="3">called on to sing entire songs.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="3">Harry Cheeseballs will Hare the next Hash,
September 3rd.<br>
Nope not a</font></b> <b><font size="3">typo it was decided by the entire Hash
present to switch to Saturdays</font></b> <b><font size="3">during the football
